        <h2>Cast</h2>
        <h3><u>Player Character - The Newbie</u></h3>
        <p> The player character can be named by the player, but their default name is Jackie. Their
            gender can also be chosen by the player. Shortly before the story begins, they applied
            for a job as a video game playtester at publisher Nomina Games and got accepted. When
            the game starts, they are moving to Elysa, the city in which Nomina is located. Their
            new apartment happens to be in the same building as the company’s offices, just a few
            floors higher. The team they join is referred to as Development Team 51, and besides
                <span class="g">G</span> is comprised of six other members. </p><br />
        <h3><u><span class="g">G - The Unseen Leader</span></u></h3>
        <p>
            <span class="g">G</span> is the mysterious leader of Dev Team 51 and the original
            visionary for <i>Common Grounds</i>. Due to dubious circumstances, they are managing the
            team remotely from another undisclosed location. <span class="g">G</span> is the one who
            conducted the player’s job interview, though it was done completely over the internet
            and neither one saw the other’s face. </p><br />
        <h3><u><span class="r">Ren Kang - The Lead Programmer</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Friendly competition, computers</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Greediness, gambling, social media</p><br />
        <p>
            <span class="r">Ren</span> is the programmer of <i>Common Grounds</i>. He comes from a
            wealthy family and was homeschooled. As a result, he has met most of his friends online.
            He was formerly a member of an amateur esports team, but recently quit. He enjoys MMOs,
            MOBAs, and other cooperative multiplayer games, and he prefers to play games on PC. </p><br />

        <p>Themes of <span class="r">Ren's</span> story: Accountability</p><br />
        <h3><u><span class="a">Amelia Ulrich - The Marketing Manager</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Her younger siblings, staying informed</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Dishonesty, people who talk too much</p><br />
        <p>
            <span class="a">Amelia</span> is a newly hired marketing intern who has been assigned by
            Nomina to market <i>Common Grounds</i>. She often questions the morality of her own
            work, believing most marketing strategies to be dishonest and manipulative. She is
            fairly introverted, but skilled at reading social cues and not afraid to call people out
            on their mistakes. Her only experience with video games is watching her brother and
            sister play them from time to time. She spends much of her time taking care of her
            younger siblings, as her parents are frequently traveling for work.</p><br />
        <p> Relationships: <span class="a">Amelia</span> is constantly at odds with <span class="y"
                >Yosef</span> due to their conflicting personalities. </p><br />
        <p>Themes of <span class="a">Amelia's</span> story: Honesty, Family</p><br />
        <h3><u><span class="y">Yosef Peters - The Finance Manager</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Being valued, meeting new people, motorcycles</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Party-poopers, fancy words</p><br />
        <p>
            <span class="y">Yosef</span> is a newly hired financial expert who has been assigned by
            Nomina to manage the finances for Dev Team 51. He is the oldest member of the team and
            enjoys acting as a mentor figure toward his colleagues, despite being new to the
            company. Born in Eastern Europe, he moved to the United States after graduating from
            college. He knows almost nothing about video games, only that they are a rapidly growing
            industry. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: Despite his best efforts to be friends with everybody, <span class="y"
                >Yosef</span> is constantly at odds with <span class="a">Amelia</span> due to their
            conflicting personalities. Because of his intense sociability, some members of the team
            like <span class="d">Donovan</span> and <span class="n">Noel</span> find him somewhat
            intimidating.</p><br />
        <p>Themes of <span class="y">Yosef's</span> story: Self-worth</p><br />
        <h3><u><span class="d">Donovan Farley - The Writer</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Writing, video games, night time</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Talking, hypocrisy, unwanted opinions</p><br />
        <p>
            <span class="d">Donovan</span> is the main writer of <i>Common Grounds</i>. He is very
            socially withdrawn and would rather express his thoughts through writing than speaking.
            He has yet to really open up to any of his teammates. He plays video games the most out
            of everyone on the team, with a preference for narrative-driven games on home consoles.
            Despite his introversion, he has apparently known <span class="g">G</span> the longest
            out of anyone on the team. </p><br />

        <h3><u><span class="o">Olive Estrada - The Composer</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Social media, plants</p>
        <p>Dislikes: school</p><br />
        <p>
            <span class="o">Olive</span> is the composer for the soundtrack of <i>Common
            Grounds</i>. She has a passion for music of all kinds. However, that passion tends to be
            in the form of listening to music rather than making it herself. Some might call her
            lazy, but she would strongly disagree. Her passion for music does not always translate
            to talent in creating it. She enjoys cozy, laid-back games with simplistic gameplay, and
            most often plays them on her phone. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: <span class="o">Olive</span> has been friends with <span class="n"
                >Noel</span> since high school. The two of them are currently roommates and applied
            to work at Nomina together. She also gets along well with <span class="r">Ren</span>
            since they are both outgoing.</p><br />
        <p>Themes of <span class="o">Olive's</span> story: Acknowledging limitations</p><br />
        <h3><u><span class="n">Noel Richards - The Artist</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Cute animals, cartoons</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Critics, confrontation, trying new things</p><br />
        <p>
            <span class="n">Noel</span> is the artist for <i>Common Grounds</i>. She is immensely
            shy, but secretly wishes for praise and approval. While she is humble about it, she is
            very academically gifted and once wished to become a teacher. She is currently attending
            art school while doing commissions for Nomina Games. She does not have much experience
            with video games, but is interested in them. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: <span class="n">Noel</span> and <span class="o">Olive</span> have been
            friends since high school. The two of them are currently roommates and applied to work
            at Nomina together.</p><br />
