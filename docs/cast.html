        <h3><u>Player Character</u></h3>
        <p> The player character can be named by the player, but their default name is Jackie. Their
            gender can also be chosen by the player. Shortly before the story begins, they applied
            for a job as a video game playtester at publisher Nomina Games and got accepted. The
            game begins with them being introduced to their new workplace and colleagues.</p><br />

            visionary for ___. Due to dubious circumstances, they are managing the
            team remotely from another undisclosed location. <span class="g">G</span> is the one who
            conducted the player’s job interview, though it was done completely over the internet
            and neither one saw the other’s face. </p><br />-->

            <span class="r">Ren</span> is the programmer of ___. He comes from a wealthy family and
            was homeschooled. As a result, he has met most of his friends online. He was formerly a

            cooperative multiplayer games, and he prefers to play games on PC. </p>

        <p>
            <span class="a">Amelia</span> is a newly hired marketing intern who has been assigned by
            Nomina to market ___. She often questions the morality of her own work, believing most
            marketing strategies to be dishonest and manipulative. She is fairly introverted, but
            skilled at reading social cues and not afraid to call people out on their mistakes. Her
            only experience with video games is watching her brother and sister play them from time
            to time. She spends much of her time taking care of her younger siblings, as her parents
            are frequently traveling for work. <span class="a">Amelia</span> is the first member of her family to go to
            college, which is something that she is proud of and does not take for granted. </p>
        <p> Relationships: <span class="a">Amelia</span> is constantly at odds with <span class="y"
                >Yosef</span> due to their conflicting personalities. </p>

        <p>Age: 33</p>
        <p>Likes: being valued, meeting new people, motorcycles<br />Dislikes: party-poopers,
            pretentiousness</p>
        <p>
            <span class="y">Yosef</span> is a newly hired financial expert who has been assigned by
            Nomina to manage the finances for Dev Team 51. He is the oldest member of the team and
            enjoys acting as a mentor figure toward his colleagues, despite being new to the
            company. Born in Eastern Europe, he moved to the United States after graduating from
            college. He knows almost nothing about video games, only that they are a rapidly growing
            industry. </p>
        <p> Relationships: Despite his best efforts to be friends with everybody, <span class="y"
                >Yosef</span> is constantly at odds with <span class="a">Amelia</span> due to their
            conflicting personalities. Because of his intense sociability, some members of the team
            like <span class="d">Donovan</span> and <span class="n">Noel</span> find him somewhat
            intimidating.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Age: 25</p>
        <p>Likes: writing, video games, night time<br />Dislikes: talking, hypocrisy, unwanted
            opinions</p>
        <p>
            <span class="d">Donovan</span> is the main writer of ___. He is very socially withdrawn
            and would rather express his thoughts through writing than speaking. He has yet to
            really open up to any of his teammates. He plays video games the most out of everyone on
            the team, with a preference for narrative-driven games on home consoles. While <span class="d">Donovan</span> does try to get input and feedback from his teammates, most of the dialogue in _ comes from his own mind.

        <p>
            <span class="o">Olive</span> is the composer for the soundtrack of ___. She has a
            passion for music of all kinds. However, that passion tends to be in the form of
            listening to music rather than making it herself. Some might call her lazy, but she
            would strongly disagree. Her passion for music does not always translate to talent in
            creating it. She enjoys cozy, laid-back games with simplistic gameplay, and most often
            plays them on her phone. </p>
        <p> Relationships: <span class="o">Olive</span> has been friends with <span class="n"
                >Noel</span> since high school. The two of them are currently roommates and applied
            to work at Nomina together. She also gets along well with <span class="r">Ren</span>
            since they are both outgoing.</p>

        <p>
            <span class="n">Noel</span> is the artist for ___. She is immensely shy, but secretly
            wishes for praise and approval. While she is humble about it, she is very academically
            gifted and once wished to become a teacher. She is currently attending art school while
            doing commissions for Nomina Games. She does not have much experience with video games,
            but is interested in them. </p>
        <p> Relationships: <span class="n">Noel</span> and <span class="o">Olive</span> have been
            friends since high school. The two of them are currently roommates and applied to work
