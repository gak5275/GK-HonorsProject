        <p> The player character can be named by the player, but their default name is Jackie. 
            Their gender can also be chosen by the player. 
            Shortly before the story begins, they applied for a job as a video game playtester at publisher Nomina Games and got accepted. 
            When the game starts, they are moving to Elysa, the city in which Nomina is located. 
            Their new apartment happens to be in the same building as the company’s offices, just a few floors higher. </p><br />

            He was formerly a member of an amateur esports team, but recently quit. 
            He enjoys MMOs, MOBAs, and other cooperative multiplayer games, and he prefers to play games on PC. </p><br />

        <p> Amelia is a newly hired marketing intern who has been assigned by Nomina to market Common Grounds. 
            She often questions the morality of her own work, believing most marketing strategies to be dishonest and manipulative. 
            Her only experience with video games is watching her brother and sister play them from time to time. 
            She is constantly at odds with Yosef due to their conflicting personalities. </p><br />

            He knows almost nothing about video games, only that they are a rapidly growing industry.

        <p>Dislikes: Talking, hypocrisy, children</p><br />
        <p> Donovan is the main writer of Common Grounds. 
            He is very socially withdrawn and would rather express his thoughts through writing than speaking. 
            He has yet to really open up to any of his teammates. 
            He plays video games the most out of everyone on the team, with a preference for narrative-driven games on home consoles. 
            Despite his introversion, he has apparently known G the longest out of anyone on the team. </p><br />

        <p> Olive is the composer for the soundtrack of Common Grounds. 
            While she has a basic understanding of music composition, she much prefers to listen to and discuss music than make her own. 
            Her passion for music does not always translate to talent in creating it.
            She enjoys cozy, laid-back games with simplistic gameplay, and most often plays them on her phone. 
            She has been friends with Noel since high school. 
            The two of them are currently roommates and applied to work at Nomina together. </p><br />

        <p>Dislikes: Critics, confrontation, trying new things</p><br />
        <p> Noel is the artist for Common Grounds. 
            She is shy and lacks self-confidence, believing that she is far less talented of an artist than she actually is. 
            She is often hesitant to show her work to others.
            She does not have much experience with video games, but is interested in them. 
            She and Olive have been friends since high school. 
            The two of them are currently roommates and applied to work at Nomina together. </p><br />
