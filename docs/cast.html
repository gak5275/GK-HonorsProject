        <h3><u>Player Character - The Newbie</u></h3>
        <p> The player character can be named by the player, but their default name is Jackie. 
            Their gender can also be chosen by the player. 
            Shortly before the story begins, they applied for a job as a video game playtester at publisher Nomina Games and got accepted. 
            When the game starts, they are moving to Elysa, the city in which Nomina is located. 
            Their new apartment happens to be in the same building as the company’s offices, just a few floors higher. 
            The team they join is referred to as Development Team 51, and besides <span class="g">G</span> is comprised of six other members. </p><br />
        
        <h3><u><span class="g">G - The Unseen Leader</span></u></h3>
        <p> <span class="g">G</span> is the mysterious leader of Dev Team 51 and the original visionary for <i>Common Grounds</i>. 
            Due to dubious circumstances, they are managing the team remotely from another undisclosed location. 
            <span class="g">G</span> is the one who conducted the player’s job interview, though it was done completely over the internet and neither one saw the other’s face. </p><br />
        
        <h3><u><span class="r">Ren Kang - The Lead Programmer</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Friendly competition, computers</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Greediness, gambling, social media</p><br />
        <p> <span class="r">Ren</span> is the programmer of <i>Common Grounds</i>. 
            He comes from a wealthy family and was homeschooled. 
            As a result, he has met most of his friends online. 
            He was formerly a member of an amateur esports team, but recently quit. 
            He enjoys MMOs, MOBAs, and other cooperative multiplayer games, and he prefers to play games on PC. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: </p><br />
        
        <h3><u><span class="a">Amelia Ulrich - The Marketing Manager</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Her younger siblings, staying informed</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Dishonesty, people who talk too much</p><br />
        <p> <span class="a">Amelia</span> is a newly hired marketing intern who has been assigned by Nomina to market <i>Common Grounds</i>. 
            She often questions the morality of her own work, believing most marketing strategies to be dishonest and manipulative. 
            Her only experience with video games is watching her brother and sister play them from time to time. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: <span class="a">Amelia</span> is constantly at odds with <span class="y">Yosef</span> due to their conflicting personalities. </p><br />
        
        <h3><u><span class="y">Yosef Peters - The Finance Manager</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Being valued, meeting new people, motorcycles</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Party-poopers, fancy words</p><br />
        <p> <span class="y">Yosef</span> is a newly hired financial expert who has been assigned by Nomina to manage the finances for Dev Team 51. 
            He is the oldest member of the team and enjoys acting as a mentor figure toward his colleagues, despite being new to the company. 
            Born in Eastern Europe, he moved to the United States after graduating from college. 
            He knows almost nothing about video games, only that they are a rapidly growing industry. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: Despite his best efforts to be friends with everybody, <span class="y">Yosef</span> is constantly at odds with <span class="a">Amelia</span> due to their conflicting personalities.
            Because of his intense sociability, some members of the team like <span class="d">Donovan</span> and <span class="n">Noel</span> find him somewhat intimidating.</p><br />
        
        <h3><u><span class="d">Donovan Farley - The Writer</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Writing, video games, night time</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Talking, hypocrisy, children</p><br />
        <p> <span class="d">Donovan</span> is the main writer of <i>Common Grounds</i>. 
            He is very socially withdrawn and would rather express his thoughts through writing than speaking. 
            He has yet to really open up to any of his teammates. 
            He plays video games the most out of everyone on the team, with a preference for narrative-driven games on home consoles. 
            Despite his introversion, he has apparently known <span class="g">G</span> the longest out of anyone on the team. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: </p><br />

        <p>Likes: Social media, plants</p>
        <p>Dislikes: school</p><br />
        <p> <span class="o">Olive</span> is the composer for the soundtrack of <i>Common Grounds</i>. 
            While she has a basic understanding of music composition, she much prefers to listen to and discuss music than make her own. 
            Her passion for music does not always translate to talent in creating it.
            She enjoys cozy, laid-back games with simplistic gameplay, and most often plays them on her phone. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: <span class="o">Olive</span> has been friends with <span class="n">Noel</span> since high school. 
            The two of them are currently roommates and applied to work at Nomina together.</p><br />
        
        <h3><u><span class="n">Noel Richards - The Artist</span></u></h3>
        <p>Likes: Cute animals, cartoons</p>
        <p>Dislikes: Critics, confrontation, trying new things</p><br />
        <p> <span class="n">Noel</span> is the artist for <i>Common Grounds</i>. 
            She is shy and lacks self-confidence, believing that she is far less talented of an artist than she actually is. 
            She is often hesitant to show her work to others.
            She does not have much experience with video games, but is interested in them. </p><br />
        <p> Relationships: <span class="n">Noel</span> and <span class="o">Olive</span> have been friends since high school. 
            The two of them are currently roommates and applied to work at Nomina together.</p><br />
