        <h2>Thesis Proposal</h2>
        <h3>Making a Game About Making Games</h3>
        <p> My objective for my project is to create an informative and entertaining story-driven
            game that conveys the challenges of working in the modern video game industry through
            its narrative and characters. I began envisioning the game's premise last fall and have
            been adding more ideas about the story and characters as I come up with them. I will
            begin writing for the game this summer, and begin developing the game in Unity in the
            fall. The written component of my thesis will detail the creation process of my game and
            the research that I am conducting. </p>
        <p> The intended outcome of my project is for myself and anyone who plays my game to gain a
            better understanding of what it is like to work in the video game industry, including
            the struggles that those who make games face on a regular basis. I will publish the game
            on the website itch.io. </p>
        <p> I will earn honors credits from an independent study (DIGIT 496) and the DIGIT senior
            project (DIGIT 494). </p>
        <p> I will meet with my thesis advisor once each week during my senior year. </p>
        <p> My thesis will satisfy six honors credits as well as my senior project in the DIGIT
            major. </p>
