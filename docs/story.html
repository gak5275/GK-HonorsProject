        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p> The player has just been hired by an independent game publisher as a playtester for
            their upcoming narrative-adventure game, titled <i>Common Grounds</i>. The game is being worked
            on by an indie development studio made up of only six people, as well as their lead
            developer. Moving to a new city, the player begins their new job as the playtester for
            <i>Common Grounds</i> and builds friendships with each of their team members. </p>
        <p> As work on <i>Common Grounds</i> progresses, it becomes more and more clear that the publisher
            funding the project, Nomina Games, is more concerned about how well the game performs
            than they are with the game’s quality or what it represents, and have no regard for the
            work-life balance of their developers either. This is made known to the public when
            Nomina Games is outed as an immoral and corrupt company at the Developers Conference and
            Showcase (DCS). </p>
        <p> <b>Eventually, the team (and the player) must make a choice: Continue to rely on Nomina as
            a reliable publisher despite conflicting values, or abandon Nomina and self-publish the
            game, even though this would extend development time and require each team member to
            take a second job in order to both fund the game and make a living. They would also lose
            the rights to the name <i>Common Grounds</i>, as the name is owned by Nomina.</b> </p>
        <p> If the player chooses to stay with Nomina, they will finish the game in undesirable
            working conditions and their vision will be corrupted by executive meddling. When the
            game releases a month later, fans and critics are divided on whether or not it is
            actually good, but it still ends up being financially successful. The team becomes an
            in-house developer for Nomina and is immediately assigned to work on a sequel, despite
            suffering from burnout and a lack of ideas. This will be called “The Lost” ending. </p>
        <p> If the player chooses to cut ties with Nomina, they will lose all funding for the
            project as well as the naming rights, but can now self-publish the game and no longer have
            to endure the poor working environment. The team can now work at their own pace and use
            whatever ideas they want. However, they are no longer backed by a publisher, so each
            team member must take a second job in order to keep the project funded. This caused
            development to take another whole year, but working on the game became significantly
            more enjoyable and the team’s relationships with one another strengthened as a result.
            When the game does eventually release, it does so to moderate success and a small but
            adoring audience. It is also given a new title: <i>Everyday</i>. This will be called “The
            Wanderer” ending. </p><br/>
