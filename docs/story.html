        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p> The player has just been hired by an independent game publisher as a playtester for
            their upcoming narrative-adventure game, titled <i>Common Grounds</i>. The game is being
            worked on by an indie development studio made up of only six people, as well as their
            lead developer. Moving to a new city, the player begins their new job as the playtester
            for <i>Common Grounds</i> and builds friendships with each of their team members. </p>
        <p><i>Common Grounds</i> is being published by Nomina Games, a company known for publishing
            promising indie projects. After being introduced to their team members, the player soon
            meets the higher-ups of Nomina Games, including its CEO and its Head of Marketing.</p>
        <p> As work on <i>Common Grounds</i> progresses, it becomes more and more clear that some of
            the ones in charge of Nomina Games are more concerned about how well the game performs
            than they are with the game’s quality or what it represents, and have no regard for the
            work-life balance of their developers either. These details are exposed to the public
            when Nomina Games is outed as an immoral and corrupt company during a guest presentation
            at Pennington University. </p>
        <p>
            <b>Eventually, the team (and the player) must make a choice: Continue to rely on Nomina
                as a reliable publisher despite conflicting values, or abandon Nomina and
                self-publish the game, even though this would extend development time and require
                each team member to take a second job in order to both fund the game and make a
                living. They would also lose the rights to the name <i>Common Grounds</i>, as the
                name is owned by Nomina.</b>
        </p>
        <p> If the player chooses to stay with Nomina, they will finish the game in undesirable
            working conditions and their vision will be corrupted by executive meddling. When the
            game releases a month later, fans and critics are divided on whether or not it is
            actually good, but it still ends up being financially successful. The team becomes an
            in-house developer for Nomina and is immediately assigned to work on a sequel, despite
            suffering from burnout and a lack of ideas. This will be called “The Lost” ending. </p>
        <p> If the player chooses to cut ties with Nomina, they will lose all funding for the
            project as well as the naming rights, but can now self-publish the game and no longer
            have to endure the poor working environment. The team can now work at their own pace and
            use whatever ideas they want. However, they are no longer backed by a publisher, so each
            team member must take a second job in order to keep the project funded. This caused
            development to take another whole year, but working on the game became significantly
            more enjoyable and the team’s relationships with one another strengthened as a result.
            When the game does eventually release, it does so to moderate success and a small but
            adoring audience. It is also given a new title: <i>Everyday</i>. This will be called
            “The Wanderer” ending. </p><br />
        <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p>The game is set in Autumn of 2023 in the city of Elysa, somewhere in the United States.
            Elysa is one of the most modern and technologically advanced cities in the US, having
            been founded only a couple of decades ago in 2001. Strangely though, the player
            character had never even heard of the city until applying at Nomina Games. </p>
