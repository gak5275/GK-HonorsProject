        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p> The player has just been hired by an independent game publisher as a playtester for
            their upcoming narrative-adventure game, titled ___. The game is being worked on by an
            indie development studio made up of only six people. Moving to a new city, the player
            begins their new job as the playtester for ___ and builds friendships with each of their
            team members. </p>
        <p>___ is being published by Nomina Games, a company known for publishing promising indie
            projects. After being introduced to their team members, the player soon meets the
            higher-ups of Nomina Games, including its CEO and its Head of Marketing.</p>
        <p> As work on ___ progresses, it becomes more and more clear that some of the ones in
            charge of Nomina Games are more concerned about how well the game performs than they are
            with the game’s quality or what it represents, and have no regard for the work-life
            balance of their developers either. These details are exposed to the public when Nomina
            Games is outed as an immoral and corrupt company during a guest presentation at a local
            University. </p>
        <p> Eventually, the team (and the player) must make a choice: Continue to rely on Nomina as
            a reliable publisher despite conflicting values, or abandon Nomina and self-publish the
            game, even though this would extend development time and require each team member to
            take a second job in order to both fund the game and make a living. They would also lose
            the rights to the name ___, as the name is owned by Nomina. </p>
        <p>After carefully thinking it over, the team chooses to cut ties with Nomina. They will
            lose all funding for the project (and the naming rights?), but can now self-publish the
            game and no longer have to endure the poor working environment. The team can now work at
            their own pace and use whatever ideas they want. However, they are no longer backed by a
            publisher, so each team member must take a second job in order to keep the project
            funded. This caused development to take another whole year, but working on the game
            became significantly more enjoyable and the team’s relationships with one another
            strengthened as a result. When the game does eventually release, it does so to moderate
            success and a small but adoring audience. It is also given a new title: <i>Everyday</i>. </p>
        <!--<p> If the player chooses to stay with Nomina, they will finish the game in undesirable
            working conditions and their vision will be corrupted by executive meddling. When the
            game releases a month later, fans and critics are divided on whether or not it is
            actually good, but it still ends up being financially successful. The team becomes an
            in-house developer for Nomina and is immediately assigned to work on a sequel, despite
            suffering from burnout and a lack of ideas. This will be called “The Lost” ending. </p>
        <p> If the player chooses to cut ties with Nomina, they will lose all funding for the
            project as well as the naming rights, but can now self-publish the game and no longer
            have to endure the poor working environment. The team can now work at their own pace and
            use whatever ideas they want. However, they are no longer backed by a publisher, so each
            team member must take a second job in order to keep the project funded. This caused
            development to take another whole year, but working on the game became significantly
            more enjoyable and the team’s relationships with one another strengthened as a result.
            When the game does eventually release, it does so to moderate success and a small but
            adoring audience. It is also given a new title: <i>Everyday</i>. This will be called
            “The Wanderer” ending. </p><br />-->
        <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p>Where - Most scenes will take place in the office/studio where the team works, though
            there may be other locations as well. <i>Everyday</i> takes place in a city in the United
            States, but the exact setting will remain mostly ambiguous.</p>
        <p>When - <i>Everyday</i> is set in the present day, specifically late 2023. I would like for
            certain relevant issues (such as artificial intelligence and its role in creative
            processes) to be topics of discussion amongst the characters.</p>
