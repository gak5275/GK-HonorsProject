        <p>My name is Graydon Kupfer, and I am a junior at Penn State Behrend. My major is Digital
            Media, Arts, and Technology (commonly referred to as DIGIT).</p>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>Everyday is a visual novel in which the player meets and befriends a cast of characters
            over the course of several in-game weeks. The story will be told through a series of
            scenes in which the player will get to know the characters. Some of these scenes can be
            experienced in a player-chosen order, and almost all of them will have dialogue choices
            for the player to make. There may also be multiple endings that the player can get,
            depending on certain choices they make.</p><br/>
        <p>Everyday takes place over the course of _
            in-game weeks. Each week, the player can choose which characters to interact with and
            when. Each day, the player will be presented with a map screen and can see where each of
            the six characters are located. Traveling to the location of a character will initiate
            an event with them. Through these events, the player will get to know each character
            better and witness their character development, as well as learn about their
            relationships with each other. Once per week the entire team will meet at the
            office/studio to check in on development progress. It will be primarily during these
            events that the main story advances. </p><br/>
