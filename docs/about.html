        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My project for the Schreyer Honors Program will be a visual novel titled <i>Everyday</i>. Everyday is a visual novel in which the player meets and befriends 
            a cast of characters over the course of several in-game weeks. The story will be told through a series of scenes in which the player will get to know the 
            characters. Some of these scenes can be experienced in a player-chosen order, and almost all of them will have dialogue choices for the player to make. 
            There may also be multiple endings that the player can get, depending on certain choices they make.</p>
        
        <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">Wikipedia</a>: "A visual novel, often abbreviated as VN, is a form of digital semi-interactive fiction. Visual novels are often associated with and used in the 
            medium of video games, but are not always labeled as such themselves.They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree 
            of interactivity".</p>
