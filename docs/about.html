        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My project for the Schreyer Honors Program will be a visual novel titled <i>Everyday</i>.
            Everyday is a visual novel in which the player meets and befriends a cast of characters
            over the course of several in-game weeks. The story will be told through a series of
            scenes in which the player will get to know the characters. Some of these scenes can be
            experienced in a player-chosen order, and almost all of them will have dialogue choices
            for the player to make. The main story will also explore the struggles and challenges
            that can arise when working in the video game industry. Not all characters will have
            completely good intentions or sound judgement. There may be multiple endings that the
            player can get, depending on certain choices they make.</p>
        <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">Wikipedia</a>: "A visual novel,
            often abbreviated as VN, is a form of digital semi-interactive fiction. Visual novels
            are often associated with and used in the medium of video games, but are not always
            labeled as such themselves.They combine a textual narrative with static or animated
            illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity".</p>
