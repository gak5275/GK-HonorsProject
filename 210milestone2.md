# Games that have inspired my Honors Project

My Honors Project is a visual novel focused on character relationships, with game development being the driving force of the narrative. I have played a few visual novels that have heavily inspired the one that I am making, as well as several other games that have VN-like elements or are highly narrative-driven that have also inspired me in some way.

## Arcade Spirits

Arcade Spirits is a visual novel that is possibly that biggest source of inspiration for my project. Set in a world where arcade games never fell out of popularity after the 1980s, the player assumes the role of a new employee at a modest family-owned arcade. There is a small cast of characters to get to know over the course of the story, including the player's coworkers and arcade regulars.

Elements of Arcade Spirits that I want to adapt for my project:
* Formation of the cast - AS has a core cast of six main characters (not including the player or their roommate), each of which has a distinct role in the arcade. I have envisioned the characters of my own project in a similar way, with each of them having a different position on the development team. AS also associates each of its main characters with a different color, which I have done as well.
* Setting - AS primarily takes place within the arcade the player works at, though other locations are visited at certain points in the story. The main setting of my game will be the office/studio that the characters work in, but I would like there to be a variety of locations for events to take place in.
* Narrative - The setup and story that I am envisioning for my project has some similarities to the overall plot of AS, but with the player being hired to work at a game studio instead of an arcade.
* Sequence of events - In AS, there are several instances of the player being prompted to choose which character(s) they want to interact with in a given situation. However, they can only see a limited amount of events before the story progresses. I would like to incorporate this type of player choice, but I will likely not impose any extreme limits on it so that someone will only have to play through the game once to see every character's storyline to completion.
* Screen setup - AS has its screen and user interface set up like most visual novels. The character(s) are in the center of the screen against a static background, with the text box at the bottom of the screen displaying the dialogue and the name of whoever is speaking. This is the format that I would like my game to follow for the most part.

## Coffee Talk & VA-11 HALL-A

Coffee Talk and VA-11 HALL-A (pronounced "Valhalla") are two visual novels that have the player serve drinks to customers as they get to know them through dialogue. In Coffee Talk, you play as a barista serving coffee, while in Valhalla you play as a bartender serving alcohol. Coffee Talk is set in modern day with some fantasy elements, and Vallhalla is set in a dystopian sci-fi future. Characters will ask for certain drinks, and getting these requests right or wrong will change the dialogue to some degree. I put these two together because they are very similiar games, though they were made by different studios.

These two VNs inspired me in similar ways to Arcade Spirits, but the biggest aspect of them that I am envisioning for my own game is their artstyle. Both games are done in visually-appealing pixel art. Pixel art is the most feasible art direction for someone like me who is not a great artist. This is one part of my project that I may have too high of hopes for...

## Other narrative-driven games that have inspired my own project:

* ### Stardew Valley
* ### Fire Emblem
* ### Persona

Stardew Valley is a farming/life simulation game in which the player moves to a small rural town after inheriting an old farmstead. The player can build friendships with most of the characters living in the town by talking to them and giving them gifts. How good your relationship with each character is can be seen in one of the menu tabs. Once you reach a certain relationship level with a character, you have a chance of seeing an event play out in which you learn more about them. The game's 12 main characters each have six of these events to see as you become better friends with them. These events might just reveal more of their personality, or be a series of steps in a character arc of sorts. While I do not plan to incorporate gift-giving or friendship meters into my game, I would like for each of my characters to have a similar series of events in which they grow and change.

Fire Emblem and Persona both have their own versions of this concept, but they are different in many ways as well.
