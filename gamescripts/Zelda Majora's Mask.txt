--------------------
What is a text dump?
--------------------
A text dump contains all the text in a video game, ripped
straight from the ROM. I use a script to convert the ROM code
into formatted, readable text, in either TXT or HTML format.
Why is this useful? It is often useful, when theorizing about
Zelda, to have exact quotes handy. These text dumps put all
the text in the Zelda games at one's fingertips.

A word of warning though: internally, the ROMs arrange the
quotes in essentially random order. There is a little bit of
structure: for example, though one person's dialogue may be
split up into separate quotes, these quotes will generally
be all together, in order. But if you wish to find a specific
quote from the game, you will have to already know a few words
from the quote so that you can search through the entire text
dump. Any decent text editor should have a Search function,
and you'll need to use it to find anything specific in the
text dumps.


------------------------------------------------------
Where can I get the latest version of your text dumps?
------------------------------------------------------
If you downloaded this file off of a site like GameFAQs.com,
you might have an out-of-date version. This is because I only
submitted the text dumps to FAQ sites once, just so people
would know that these text dumps exist. Updated versions can
be obtained at my web site (The Legends of Zelda -
http://loz.zeldalegends.net) in the Emulation section.
Compare the revision date at the top of this document with
the one in the files on my site to see if you have the latest
version.


---------------------------
How do you make text dumps?
---------------------------
I include the following information for those who are curious.
If you don't understand any of it, just skip ahead.

The first step in making a text dump is to have a copy of the
ROM. Then, if you have a quote from the game, you can search
for the text. Newer games (like OoT, MM, and LA) use standard
ASCII values for raw text, so it is possible to find the text
using any common text editor. Older games (like LoZ, AoL, and
ALttP), unfortunately, don't use ASCII standards, so it's
necessary to do a relative search using a hex editor like
Thingy. Then you can make a translation table that will allow
Thingy to translate ROM text into standard ASCII text. (There
are many freeware utilities available that will help you do
relative searches and make translation tables.)

To make things even more difficult, some games compress, or
encrypt, the text. For example, in Oracle of Seasons the hex
value "02 0E" translates to "Twinrova." ALttP uses compression
and doesn't use standard ASCII values, so this is the most
difficult game to dump. OoS and OoA use ASCII standards but
have text compression. Fortunately, I already have TBL files
for both of these games, so dumping is not as difficult as it
could have been. ^_^

After you have found the text (and you're sure you've found
ALL the text), copy and paste all the text you can find into
a new file. This is what the DMP files on my site are: all the
text I could find, copied and pasted straight out of the ROM.
Once this is done, I wrote a PHP script to parse the DMP file
and translate everything into a readable format (TXT or HTML).
Making a program is the easiest thing to do in the long run
(though something more powerful than PHP is usually preferable),
because it takes a while to find out what all the codes in the
ROM translate to. Using the standard Find/Replace function of
a text editor is too much work if what you're searching for
constantly changes.

Hey! If I call you, press (^) right
away!

I can tell you're not very used to
your Deku Scrub body yet.

All right, listen up! If you press
and hold (A) as a Deku Scrub
while standing on a Deku Flower,
you can dive into it.
If you wait a bit before releasing
(A), you'll launch out of the
flower. Press (A) while flying to
descend.

Did you get that?
 
No
Yes

Are you sure?

One more thing: Press (A) when
you're on the ground to perform a
spin attack!

This place stinks just like that
poison swamp!

What do you think that is?

This looks pretty light.
Well, don't just stand there--
Press (A) to grab it and use (+)
to move it!

This torch is still warm...

Be careful...
I sense a lot of evil here.

Look!
From up here, we have a better
view of that shrine below. 

Hey, I'm trying to tell you
something...
This torch is still warm, too.

What? It's an icicle!
It's just like the one we saw
outside!

Hmm...This is kind of big...
It's gonna take more than average
strength to move this thing!

What, you think you can push
down something this big just by
standing on top of it?

You're going to have to find some
way to pound it down.

W-What just happened?!
Everything has...

...started over...

Wha...What are you, anyway? 
That song you played...
That instrument...

...That instrument!!!

Wait! That's it!
Your instrument!!!

The mask salesman said that if
you got back the precious thing
that was stolen from you, he
could return you to normal!
Did you completely forget or
what?

He gives me the creeps! That
mask salesman was the...
Sorry...just thinking aloud.

But three days? Even if we never
sleep, that still leaves us with a
measly 72 hours!
Talk about demanding!
Well, don't just stand there!
We're going to see the
Great Fairy!

Look, you wanna find the Skull
Kid, don't you?

The Great Fairy will know what
he's up to. She watches over
everything.

And just between you and me,
the Skull Kid is no match for the
Great Fairy.

Go to the shrine near the
North Gate. You'll find the
Great Fairy in there!

That mask...
The Skull Kid uses the power of
that mask to do those terrible
things.
Well...whatever it takes, we've
gotta do something about it.

...The swamp, mountains, ocean and
canyon that Tael was trying to
tell us about...

I bet he was referring to the
four areas just outside town.
There's one in each compass
direction.
But what do you suppose he
meant by "the four who are
there?"

I have no idea. He always
skips important stuff. I guess we
should just go and find out...

If we go through that gate
straight ahead, we'll be heading in
the direction of the swamp.

Oh! I remember this!

Tael and I drew this with the
Skull Kid when we first met him...

He told us that he had been
fighting with his friends and that
they had left him all alone...

I'm sure it was because he was
always playing tricks, so nobody
wanted to play with him.

But to do what he did just
because of that...

And once he got his power...

Oh no! The Great Fairy!

Hey, aren't you going to the
Great Fairy's shrine near the
North Gate?

That Skull Kid has gone too far!
We can't just let this happen!

Quick! We have to find the
Stray Fairy in town and return
the Great Fairy to normal!

What are you doing?
Aren't you gonna take this fairy
to the shrine near the North
Gate?

The Great Fairy said the
astronomer knows the Skull Kid...

Hurry! We need to find a way to
get out of town and to the
observatory!

He said the secret route is in
East Clock Town...
So why aren't you going there?

Don't tell me you forgot
the code!!!

I wonder how the astronomer
knows the Skull Kid?

What's the Skull Kid doing all the
way up there?!

Well, whatever...
But aren't you at least interested
in that thing that fell from the
moon?

The door to the clock tower opens
only once a year--at midnight on
the eve of the carnival.

Did you hear those fireworks?
I think the clock tower door has
just opened!

Hey, you! C'mon! Press (Z) and
talk to me!

There you go! See? You can do it
if you try!

When I fly over to people or
objects, use (Z) to look at them
so you can talk to them.

Use Z Targeting to talk to people
even if they're far away.
 

Or, if there's no one to target,
you can use (Z) to look straight
ahead. 

But enough about that for now...
Come over to this tree and check
it out!

It's strange, but the way you look
right now sort of looks like this
tree...

It looks all dark and gloomy...
almost like it could start crying
any second now...
How sad... 

The four people Tael talked
about...

Do you think he was talking about
the spirit that was sealed inside
that mask?

...Oh! Hey, you were pretty good
out there!
Have you done this before or
what?

Now, just keep up that pace and
save the other three!

Hey!

Um...

All that stuff I did to you...
...your horse...
I...I apologize.

...Sorry.

There! I apologized!
So don't hold it against me,
got it?

Now then, we've helped the
princess just like the monkey
asked...

So now our next stop is in the
mountains! Let's hurry and do
something about that Skull Kid!

The quickest way to the mountains
is through the North Gate!

The quickest way to the ocean is
through the West Gate!

The quickest way to the canyon is
through the East Gate!

What's with that Deku Scrub?
It's just sleeping here like a lazy
fool! What a pain!

Isn't this the Deku Scrub mark?
I wonder if they worshiped here...

Whoa! He's frozen solid!
Wow! He's one ancient Goron,
isn't he?

What's that?
There's something in the middle of
that blizzard... 
Can't you see it?

Hey! Isn't this snowball bigger
than the others?

Up here! Take a look at this!
I bet if you had a weapon that
was strong enough, one shot from
it could pierce right through this!
Well, it might take two shots...

Aha! So the Gorons fall asleep if
they hear the Goron's Lullaby!
That's convenient...

Hey, how do you get up there?
I don't see anything to climb on!

What can we use?  There's really
nothing here besides that jiggly
blob.

Are these all piled on top of
one another?

We've gathered them all together,
so we just have to go to the
Clock Tower and call them!

C'mon. Let's go before it's too
late! I've had enough of all this!

C'mon! What are you doing? You
can ask Jim about the secret
route to the observatory!

Oh, why do we have to play these
stupid brats' little games?
C'mon! Hurry up and find them
already!

I can't believe you let those brats
beat you!
What are you waiting for?
Let's show 'em how it's done!

Don't you remember that
Deku Scrub who wanted the
Moon's Tear?
Don't tell me you forgot...

All right, so we know where the
Skull Kid is. Let's go ask around
the Clock Tower. Maybe we'll learn
something!

Remember? You're a Deku, so why
don't you try using this Deku
Flower?

Only � left until morning!

Whoa!!! Look at the time!
You don't even have three days
left!

Whoa!!! Look at the time! You
don't even have two days left!

Whoa!!! Look at the time! You
don't even have a single day left!

Whoa!!! Look at the time! You
don't even have half a day left!

Hey...hang on! 
Doesn't this look a little strange?

Isn't this...
a Zora egg?
I wonder how we can carry it?

That's a huge fish!
I bet that thing could eat a small
fish in a single bite...

Hey, what do you think that is?
Out there in the bay, beneath
where the gulls are flying...
Can't you see it?

I can't see it, but I sense there's
a thirst for blood looming all
around us...

Don't you have a mask that can
summon the unseen?

This mummy looks different...
Sorta like it's here waiting for its
human heart to be healed.

Well, do something!
Haven't you figured it out yet?

Here! See!
You always miss things like this.
Take a look...
The rocks are cracked here!

Whoa! That's a huge waterwheel!

Hmm...I get it...
That huge waterwheel is powering
this thing...

Why is this the only pillar that's
a different color?

...Is this a mirror?
This thing looks different from
your everyday mirror.

That's no good!
It's not stopping!
It's hopeless!

Wait! You still haven't solved the
problem with the swamp at
Woodfall!

Wait! You still haven't solved the
problem with the mountains at
Snowhead!

Wait! You still haven't solved the
problem with the ocean at
Great Bay!

Let them be! Don't you get it?

You're so insensitive!

Don't stop now!
Look! You can get up there now!

L-Look!!

Isn't that your horse?!?

I smell salt in the air, so the
ocean must be near.
But with this tall fence in the
way, we can't go any farther.
If only you had a horse to ride,
we could--Oops!
Sorry.

Hmph! This fence is the worst!
If we want to get up there, we'll
have to jump this fence!

But you can't do it like this.
I guess we'll have to give up...

This is no good!
If we could just blast these
snowballs out of the way, we
could get through!

We have a good view of their
leader's room from here.

And I bet if you needed to, you
could shoot an arrow through
these bars!

I thought this room was pretty
dark...but now I get it.

!?!
Don't tell me you still haven't
figured it out?!?

Look!
Can't you use the Hookshot on
that chest?

If you could somehow step on
top of that Octorok, I bet you'd
be able to climb onto that central
pillar.
But the Octorok is so squishy and
it keeps squirming around...
There's gotta be something you
can do!

At slippery places like this, you
can curl up as a Goron and roll
your way across! Why don't you
try it?

troublemakin' brat with the mask.

Sorry, but you can't play if you

like this...

Don't be hangin' around here!
Go home!

I swear I've seen you somewhere

Well, let me tell ya...

If you don't have a bow, you can't
play. Sorry.

Well, look at you! You've got

Sorry...If you don't have a bow,
you can't play.

Huh? You're still in town?

Haven't you heard the news

of it myself, though.

One game is 20 Rupees.
 
OK
No thanks

...Well, then, be that way!

Usually, this place is packed
during the festival...
But not this year.

Huh? You don't have a bow?
Then I guess you can't play.

Huh? You don't have a bow?
Well, that's too bad...

Oy! Oy! You don't have enough
Rupees, sonny!

You don't have enough Rupees?

So, you hit �, did ya?
Too bad...

Frustrating, ain't it?
Wanna try again?

Huh? No way!
That was perfect!

Well, here ya go!

Well look at that!
You hit �!
That's a new record!
Well, here ya go!

This may be our last day in
business, and you shot pretty
well...

Hey there, little guy!
Won't you deposit some Rupees?

Nowadays, even if people have
money, they don't deposit any.
Nothing!  Nothing!!!

So, for a limited time, I'll give you
a special gift based on how much
you deposit.

For example, if you deposit
200 Rupees, you'll get an item
that holds a lot of Rupees.

...So, what'll it be?
 
Deposit Rupees
Don't deposit Rupees

All right!

So...

How much? How much? 
�
Set the amount with (+) and
press (A) to decide.

Don't say that! C'mon...Trust me!

...Well, if you change your mind,
come back and make a deposit!

Really? Are you really
depositing �?
Yes
No

That's it? That ain't nothing at all,
big spender!
...But if you say so!

Seriously? That's a lot!
A lot! A lot!!!

Whaaat?!?
You're really gonna give me that
much? You're one rich little guy!

Is that so?
Think about it, little guy!

Zero Rupees?
Oh, that's a cruel joke!

Hmm...You play mean jokes,
little guy! You haven't even got
a single Rupee!

Come back and deposit some after
you save up a bunch!

Heyyy! You don't have that much!
You shouldn't lie to people!
And you can take that to the
bank, mister!

All right, little guy, now I've got a
total of � from you!

What's this? You've already
saved up 200 Rupees!?!

Well, little guy, here's your special
gift. Take it!

What's this? You've already saved
up 1000 Rupees!?!

Well, little guy, here's your special
gift. Take it!

What's this? You've already saved
up 5000 Rupees?!

Well, little guy, I can't take any
more deposits. Sorry, but this is
all I can give you.

...Hang on there, little guy.
I can't take any more deposits.
Sorry...

Excuuuse me! But I can't take
anymore deposits!

Sheesh, little guy! 
You're young, but you sure are
serious about saving!
I'm impressed!

Come back and deposit some after
you save up a bunch!

So, little guy, what's your name?

Hmm...
Link is it?

Got it...I won't forget your
deposits. Let me stamp you with
my special ink.

Hey, relax! It doesn't leave any
marks, and it's not gonna hurt.

There! Now I'll know you when I
see you!

What's this? You need somethin'?

What's this? You need somethin'
on a day like this?

You haven't evacuated yet? You're
amazing, little guy!

 
Deposit Rupees
Withdraw Rupees
Nothing really

Excuse me, but let me take a look
at you...

Ah, yes...Link.
If I remember, you're the little
guy who deposited �.

So...

Ah, yes...Link, right?
If I remember, you're the little guy
who deposited �.

Look, little guy, if it's 'cause of
the bad rumors going around,
forget it! They're just rumors!

How much do you want?
�
Set the amount with (+)
and press (A) to decide.

Zero Rupees?!?
That's a cruel joke!

Is that so?
Come back and deposit some after
saving up a bunch!

Are you really
withdrawing �?
Yes
No

What's this? It's a waste to take
out such a tiny bit!
...But if you say so!

Use it wisely...

Aw, you're taking out all that?
If you spend it like that, it'll all
be gone before you know it!

What's this?
Look, little guy, you can't hold
this many rupees! You got that?

...You haven't deposited that many
Rupees, so that much isn't
available for withdrawal. Do the
math! What are trying to do?

...You know, at this time of day
there's a 4 Rupee service charge
on withdrawals!

Look, little guy, all the Rupees
you deposited are gone, so you
can't use that stamp anymore.

Well, are you gonna make a
deposit?

See! Doesn't it hold more than
your old one? Fill it up and bring
it all in to deposit!

That's what they call interest!

Is that so?
Think it over, little guy!

So what are you gonna do?

Is that so?
Think it over, little guy!

So what are you gonna do?

Your deposits total

Hey, Deku Scrub, are you alone?
What happened to your parents?
Surely they are somewhere in
town worrying about you.
Go find them and leave town
together!

Stop right there, Deku Scrub!

I would like to help you get out
of town as quickly as possible,
but your parents must be looking
for you.
If I let you out now, you'll just
get lost. You had better wait
here.

Wait just a moment!

Do you know whether or not the
carnival has been canceled?

If you don't know, then never
mind. I'm just a little uneasy about
all this.

Anyway, the swamp at Woodfall
lies this way. Be careful.

Your timing for your trip to
Woodfall is great. You'd better
leave town as quickly as you can!

If you're going off to Woodfall,
your timing could not be better.

Wherever you end up going, you
should do it as quickly as you
can!

Wait just a moment!
Is everybody still in town?
What about the evacuation
warning?

Truthfully speaking, I'd flee from
this town in a moment if I could...

But since I am stuck guarding this
gate, I can't get any information
on what's going on...

No! No! I must get a hold of
myself! I must guard the gate
until the captain's orders come...

Wait just a moment!

Do you know whether or not the
carnival has been canceled?

My apologies, sir. It was wrong of
me to stop you. The mountains of
Snowhead lie this way.
Be careful.

The timing for your trip to
Snowhead is great. You'd better
leave town as quickly as you can!

Returning to Snowhead, are you?
Then you should leave as quickly
as you can!

If you're going to the mountains
of Snowhead, your timing is great.
You should leave town as quickly
as you can.

Wait just a moment!

If you came to town with your
parents, find them quickly and
leave this place!

Most everyone who believes the
moon will fall has left town.

The only ones left are those who
don't believe the rumors or aren't
aware of them.

I want to tell everyone to
evacuate, but I cannot leave my
post.

See! Look at the moon...
Leave town before the
evacuation notice is made!

Wait! I have a question!

Do you know whether or not the
carnival has been canceled?

I'm sorry to stop you, but since
I must stay at my post, I'm unable
to get any news...

I am not going to tell you
anything bad...But even Great Bay
is better than here. Just leave
town while you can.

If you're going to Great Bay, your
timing is great. You should leave
here as quickly as you can!

Returning to Great Bay, are you? 

If so, your timing is great. You
should leave here as quickly as
you can.

Wait just a moment!

Are you alone?
Aren't your parents still
somewhere in town?

Well, whatever you do, you had
better get as far away from here
as you can.

And there are still people lingering
in the stores...
If only an evacuation notice had
been posted, I would be able to
force them all to leave...

The moon has gotten so large!
Quick! Take refuge as far away
from town as you can!

Wait! I want to ask you
something!

Do you know whether or not the
carnival has been canceled?

I am sorry to bother you when
you are in such a rush.
I guess finding out the answer
would do little good, anyway.

Stone Tower is in this direction.
I shall speak no ill. Just get out
of town while you are still able.

You can get to Stone Tower from
here. You should leave town while
you can.

Wait just a moment!

If you believe that the moon truly
is falling, you'd best leave town
immediately!

Those who remain in town either
don't believe the rumors or have
given up all hope.

It pains my heart to see children
still playing in the streets
because they have no idea what's
going on...

You can get to Stone Tower from
here.

If there's even a small part of
you that believes the moon could
be falling, you should leave town
immediately.

Hey, you! Wait just a moment!
Have you some errand in the
swamp?

I cannot allow a child like you to...

...Do you have a sword?

Hey, you! Wait just a moment!

Have you some errand in the
mountains?

It is dangerous outside the town
walls, so I cannot allow a child
like you to go out alone.

Until you are old enough to carry
a weapon, you cannot pass
through here without being
accompanied by an adult.

Young one! Please hear my plea!

to pieces by the masked Skull Kid.

come see me. I shall give you

Come see me whenever you are

Well, yours is a face I'm not used
to seeing...

Are you here to do something for
me? I am Shikashi, professor of
astronomy!

I have been enamored with the
moon since I was a child.
Now, I spend my days gazing at
it from here.

The moon has long been
considered a mystical body, which
people have worshiped and feared.

That alone shows how the moon
has a cosmic influence that
affects our daily lives.

But lately, there is something
quite strange with the moon.
Strange, indeed...

It seems as though the moon is
being pulled down by something
and is slowly drawing closer.

So, will you gaze into the
telescope?
Yes
No

...I see.

Why did you stop? 
Won't you look again?
Yes
No

That is one of the lunar rocks
that has been blazing from the
surface of the moon lately.

They fall from what looks to be
the moon's eye, so I call them
Moon's Tears.

They are rare stones, valued by
many in town.

Did you have another question
for me?

To me, it seems as if the moon is
being pulled in by something and
is gradually drawing closer.

(+):Move (B):Quit (A):Zoom

Don't you sense the change in the
moon?

Well...could you see it?
It already may be impossible to
stop its descent...

All I can do is accept what the
cosmos has designed to be the
destiny for me and this planet.

How was it?
It's looking worse, isn't it?
It would be nice if things just
stayed as they are now.

How was it?

My calculations suggest the moon
will fall in another �.
I'm just hoping I was thinking too
hard.

Well, could you see it?
This is no joke...the moon is
actually falling!

At this pace, it should hit the
earth in just �...
What can we possibly do?

Well, well...A strange-looking child
has joined me today...

Are you a new friend of the
Bombers gang?

...Hmmm.
Your manners seem much better
than those of your mischievous
friend from the other day.
Hrnf, hrnf, hrnf!

That ill-mannered troublemaker
from the other day said he'd
break my instruments...

He said he'd steal my Moon's Tear...
There was no stopping him.

Even now! Just watch him! He's
probably causing trouble around
the clock tower.

Will you gaze into the
telescope?
Yes
No

Well, why not? You must take an
interest in new things while you
are still young!

Well, did you find that
troublemaker?

You can zoom in with (A).
Try looking near the clock tower.

Well, did you find that
troublemaker? And that loud
noise...What was that?

Perhaps another Moon's Tear has
fallen nearby...Go through that
door and take a look outside.

But I wonder how that
troublemaker got on top of the
clock tower?

The only way up there is through
the clock door, and that opens
only on the eve of the carnival.

What could that troublemaker be
doing atop the clock tower?

I just hope he's not plotting
another one of his no-good
tricks...

Well, you're a child I've never seen
in town before. Are you a new
friend of the Bombers?

I always say that it is important
to develop your interests while
you are young!

You can use this telescope to
look around town. If you're
interested, give it a try.

Well, how was it? Did you
discover anything interesting?

Well, why not?
You should develop your interests
while you are still young!

I've already sold out of my wares,
and the carnival hasn't even
begun.

I'm thinking of closing up shop so
I can buy a gift for my wife and
return to her in my village!

I've heard that a stone called the
Moon's Tear shines brighter than
any other in the land!

If you've got one, I'd really like
to get it from you. My wife
would love it!

If you give it to me, I'll give you
my spot here...
Deku Flower included!

If you have a Moon's Tear, I must
get it from you! My wife would
love it!

If you give it to me, I'll give you
my spot here... 
Deku Flower included!
That's a good deal!

Do you have one?

You're a Deku Scrub, so you know
just how convenient a Deku
Flower can be.

If you don't hurry, I'll give it to
another Deku Scrub. The early
Scrub gets the nut!

Ah! That stone! You must hand it
over to me!

In exchange, I'll give you my spot
here...Deku Flower included!
Yes?

You really helped me out! Now I
have the perfect souvenir for my
wife!

She hasn't set eyes on a jewel or
strange, sparkling stone like this
in a very long time.

The Title Deed for this spot
should be in high demand among
Deku Scrubs, but you already
know that.
If you don't need it anymore, you
can always sell it!

Sir! Sir!

I keep hearing about a stone
called a Moon's Tear, and it's
supposed to be the shiniest stone
in the world!
Do you have one?

If you have one, I'll trade you this
spot and I'll throw in the Deku
Flower, too!

This is a very popular spot among
Deku Scrubs. Haven't you heard
about this spot? I'm telling you,
it's a real bargain!

Sir, if you have a Moon's Tear,
I must get it from you...And I'm
not asking to get it for free!

Ah!
That stone! You must give it to
me!

In exchange, I'll give you my spot
here, and I'll throw in this Deku
Flower, too!

If you have a Moon's Tear, please
tell me! I want one as a souvenir
for my wife!

Sir, you've really helped me out!
Now I have the perfect souvenir
for my wife!

She hasn't seen a jewel or
strange, shining stone like this in
quite a long time...Hee-hee!

The Title Deed for this spot will
be in big demand by Deku Scrubs
outside of town.

You should be able to sell it to a
Deku Scrub for a good price!

This poster's an eyesore! What a
sorry collection of cowards!!
Bluh-yek! Foo!

Hey, apprentice! Don't just stand
around lookin' at the sky all
day!

Tsk! Is Brac working t'night?
I wonder if that'll get finished.

Bwah! I won't run! I'm stickin'
with my parents! I'm diff'rent from
you cowards!

Bremor! Don't be standin' 'round
lookin' at yer feet all day!

Tsk, tsk, Brac...
I wonder if this'll make it?

Bwah! I'm not gonna run! Not me!
You got that? I'm Master Mutoh's
apprentice!

I'm sorry, Bremor, but I'm going,
too!

Tsk! I knew it...
It's startin' to feel like this job'll
be impossible.

If you're gonna fall, then what's
stoppin' ya, you monster?!

Cowards! All of you!
Not a one of you stayed! My
apprentice will be disgusted with
all of you! Hmph!
I'll have a fine carnival without
you...

If you're gonna fall, then fall
already!

Wait! Wait!
Hang on!

This is my private property.
Don't try using it when I'm not
around!

Ruff-ruff!
Where'd that Deku Scrub go?
When I see his face, I get all
riled up!

The town's carnival is starting to
look a little iffy.

I'm thinking of closing up shop so
I can get a gift for my wife and
return to her in my village...

If you have a Moon's Tear, you
must give it to me!

If you do, I'll give you my spot
here, and I'll throw in this Deku
Flower, too.

Don't you have one?

You're a Deku Scrub, too, so you
know how useful a Deku Flower
can be.

If you don't hurry, I'll give it to
another Deku Scrub! The early
Scrub gets the nut!

It's the eve of the carnival, and
I can't even get to the clock
tower's stairway entrance!

This stinks worse than Dodongo
breath! Hmph! This had better be
the last of the surprises!

Hey, Deku kid! You waitin' for us
to finish the bridge from the
festival tower to the clock tower
entrance up there?
Sorry! My apprentices panicked
and ran away! This is all we get
for a festival tower. It's not quite
tall enough, is it? Sheesh!
Even if we went to the top of the
festival tower, we wouldn't be able
to get up to the clock tower
entrance!
I apologize for all this.
I wish I could scare that moon
away!

You can't carry any more.

Would you like to buy anything
else?
Yes
No

...Welcome.

I can't sell you any if you don't
have a bomb bag.

You don't have enough Rupees...
I'd like to give it to you, but
business has been slow...

Thank you very much.

We're expecting to get our larger
bomb bag back in stock pretty
soon...

But now that I think about it, it's
already late...

We just a got a larger bomb bag
in stock.

Actually, we should've had
the larger bomb bag in stock, but
it seems there was an accident 
getting it here to the store.
I don't know when we'll be getting
it now...

You can't use any of them, but
feel free to look around.

...Come again.

There'll be a fireworks show on the
night before the carnival. You
should go see it.
...Come again.

Seems there are fewer and fewer
people around...We'll still be open,
so come again...

You're still here...
You really should go see the
fireworks.

This may be the last time...

This can hold up to 30 bombs.
We just got it in stock...

Big Bomb Bag: 90 Rupees
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

Buying two of the same thing
won't do you any good...

The one you have is better, so it
would be a waste.
Save your money.

A nice fella helped me out, so we
can finally sell Big Bomb Bags!

Once again, the Giants are looking
out for me!

Umm, Mommy...
Don't go picking up bomb bags in
the middle of the night anymore.

It's like asking to be mugged.

And I've actually heard that a
thief has been lurking on the
outskirts of town...

But it's been our lifelong dream to
sell Big Bomb Bags since back in
your Daddy's day.

Since we can't get the Goron-made
goods, this was our big chance,
sonny!

I just don't want anything to
happen to you, Mommy...

Please try our Big Bomb Bag.

Look, Mommy, I don't want
anything bad to happen to you...

It's such a shame...
I thought we could finally sell Big
Bomb Bags...

Umm, Mommy...
Don't go picking up bomb bags in
the middle of the night anymore.

It's like asking to be mugged.

And doesn't the North Gate have
a reputation for being a dangerous
place?

I never would have suspected that
prancing character of anything...

It just goes to show that you
can't judge people on their
appearance.

From now on, I'll go.

Hullo. Did ya come to buy a
Powder Keg?

..This is just between us, but I
have a huge bomb that this shop
doesn't even carry.

Oh! But my product is so heavy, I
don't think you can carry it.

I'm sorry I even brought it up...

Don't tell me you came all the
way here on a day like this just
to buy bombs!

...This is just between us, but I
have a huge bomb that this store
doesn't even carry.

Oh! But my product is so heavy,
I don't think you can carry it...

I'm sorry I even brought it up...

Well, I think you should be headin'
home soon, anyway...

Look, I'd like you to buy my bomb,
too, but it's just too heavy for
you to carry.
Sorry.

Look, I think you should get outta
here and head home on the double.

Besides, my bombs are too big and
heavy for you to carry...

Oh! Of all places!

You're a Goron, so you should be
able to carry a Powder Keg,
right?

So, won't ya buy a Powder Keg
for 50 Rupees?

How 'bout it?
 
I'll buy one
No thanks

If you change your mind, come
back and see me. I'll be here for
a while.

I may not be here the next time
you come by.

Oh, but you already have one.

Powder Kegs are dangerous
explosives, so you can carry only
one at a time!

Oh, but you don't have enough
Rupees...

Powder Kegs made by my
instructor are extremely powerful.

Come back and see me if you run
out.

Powder Kegs made by my
instructor are extremely powerful.

I'll be here a little bit longer, so
come back when you need another.

Oh! Of all places!

Say, you can carry a Powder Keg,
can't you?

This may be your last chance, so
won't ya buy a Powder Keg for
50 Rupees?

If you don't have a Powder Keg,
I'll sell you one for 50 Rupees.

If you don't have a Powder Keg,
I'll sell you one for 50 Rupees!

Oh! Of all places!

You're a Goron, so you can carry
Powder Kegs, right?

Huh? Do you mean you haven't
been approved to carry Powder
Kegs, yet?

Too bad! And I was hoping I could
sell one to you...

Powder Kegs are extremely
powerful and dangerous, so those
who haven't been approved by the
instructor can't carry them.

OK, listen here. My instructor
works in the Goron Village Cave.

Come back here after he teaches
you the proper use and then
approves you to buy one.

Oh! Great timing!

You can carry Powder Kegs,
right?

Huh? Do you mean that you still
aren't approved to carry Powder
Kegs?

Too bad. I was hoping I could sell
you my last one.
 
Powder Kegs are extremely
powerful and dangerous, so those
who haven't been approved by the
Instructor can't carry them.

OK, listen here. My instructor
works in the Goron Village Cave.

Come back here after he teaches
you the proper use and then
approves you to buy one.

But the next time you come, I
might not be here.

Quick! Go to the Goron Village
Cave.

Ask my instructor to teach you
the proper way to use Powder
Kegs and get his approval.

Then I'll sell you a Powder Keg.

Quick, go to the Goron Village
Cave.

Ask my instructor to teach you
the proper way to use Powder
Kegs and get his approval.

If I'm still here, I'll sell you a
Powder Keg.

Welcome.

Heyyy! I stole that Rupee from a
crow! Don't go stealing it, man!

...Whaddya want, shrimp? I'm busy
practicing with my blowgun!

If you can't pop that balloon, then
don't mess with Jim!
Grrrr...

Are you the one who just popped
that up there? Not bad for a
Deku Scrub!

We Bombers have a hideout that
leads to the observatory outside
town.

You need a code to get in. Maybe
I'll tell you what it is!

But don't think you're getting it
that easily! I can't just tell you
what the code is...
You'll have to pass my test first.

Are you ready?
Yes
No

All right! Line up, guys!

If you can find all five of us by
tomorrow morning, I'll teach you
the code!

Are you ready?

I thought you were tougher than
that...But you're nothing special!

You did it!
So what's your name, guy?

Link, huh?

All right! That Skull Kid broke our
rules and he's been doing all
kinds of bad things lately.

Starting today, he's out! I'm
making Link a Bomber! You
guys don't mind, right?

Right!

I thought you were tougher than
that...but you're nothing special!

Wanna try again?
Yes
No

What? Don't you want me to
teach you the secret code?

This is the Bombers' Notebook.
It contains the words we live by!
Read it over!

1. Find troubled people and add
    their names and pictures.
    Only 20 people will fit in
    your book.
2. Promise to help them.
    Mark promises with Promise
    Stickers. Never be late with
    fulfilling your promises.
3. Whenever you solve someone's
    problem, it makes you happy,
    so a Happy Sticker will be
    added to your book.
4. No removing stickers!
    Use Promise Stickers to keep
    track of people until everyone
    is happy.
Don't forget the rules!

All right, then. I'll teach you our
secret code. Ready?

The code is
�!
Write it down!

What do you want, guy? 
I'm busy practicing with my
blowgun! Don't mess with me!

What do you want, you big oaf?
Adults shouldn't mess with kids'
games!

What do you want?
Don't look down at me!
Adults shouldn't mess with kids'
games!

Aw! You caught me...
Now there are only 4 left.

Aw! You caught me!
Now there are only 3 left!

Aw! You caught me!
Now there are only 2 left!

Aw! You caught me!
Now there's only 1 left!

If you're not a member, they won't
teach you the secret code!

If you wanna be a member, go see
Jim in North Clock Town!

If you want to pass through here,
you have to say the secret code!

Umm...This is a secret place just
for little kids. Adults aren't
allowed here.

What's the code?
�
Pick numbers with (+) and press
(A) to decide.

Umm...That's right. If you know the
code, then you're a member, right?
OK, here you go!

Wrong!

Jim said I can't let anyone who
doesn't know the code in. 

Aw! No way! You finally got me!

Oh, man! I didn't think you'd come
over here.

Huh?
We're playing a game right now!
Leave me alone!

Hey, guy! You haven't passed my
test, so how do you know my
secret code?

Hey, guy!
How do you know our secret
code?

Nobody but Bombers know that
code! So why do you know it?

Listen, guy!

You're pretty good!

You managed to figure out a code
that only we know! Now that's
something! I like you!

What's your name, guy?

Link, huh?
All right...That Skull Kid broke our
rules and is doing all kinds of
stuff...
I'm making Link a new
member of the Bombers instead!

Tatl, you tell that Skull Kid he's
outta here! He's been actin' like
a real jerk lately!

Hey, Link.
Are you writing in your notebook?

1. Find troubled people and add
    their names and pictures.
    Only 20 people will fit in
    your book.
2. Promise to help them.
    Mark promises with Promise
    Stickers. Don't be late

Justice forever!

You burst my balloon! 
Don't be messin' with other
people's stuff! Ya won't be able
to handle the consequences, pal!

There's a lot of cool stuff at that
telescope guy's place!

Oh, yeah...and, um...
The Bombers Secret Society of
Justice forever!

How old are you? You're not from
around here, are you? Why are
you dressed like that?
Why? Huh? Why?
Do you have any problems? Any?
If you do, tell it to us Bombers!
Tell us!

Oh! A Goron! Do you live in the
mountains? Why is Tatl with you?
Why? Huh? Why?

Do you have any problems? Any?
If you do, you can tell us
Bombers! Tell us!

Oh! A Zora! Do you live in the
ocean? What's it like? Why is
Tatl with you? Why? Huh? Why?

Do you have any problems? Any?
If you do, you can tell us
Bombers! Tell us!

Psst...Wanna know about the
Bombers?
Yes
No

Why don't you wanna know?
Why? Why?

Heh, heh! You can't tell anyone!

Every Bomber has a notebook!
Here's how we use it:

The Bombers gang is a Secret
Society of Justice. You can't tell
this to anybody...

What's with you? You're wearing a
weird hat for a Deku! Did you
come to town to play? I bet
nobody will play with you, right?

The adults are all busy getting
ready for the carnival!

The old astronomer at the
observatory outside town is the
only one who'll spend any time
playing with us kids.

The adults are busy trying to
decide whether or not to hold the
carnival!

The old astronomer at the
observatory outside town is the
only one who'll spend any time
playing with us kids!

We Bombers have our hideout at
the observatory.

You have to take a secret route
to get to it.

Oh! Don't be telling Jim in North
Clock Town that I told you that!

The secret route to the
Observatory? How do you know
about that?

Only Jim and us are supposed to
know about that secret route...

Don't tell anyone that you heard
about the secret route from me,
got it?

Hey, buddy! Have you found any
troubled people? If you do, add
'em to your notebook!

Do you remember how to use your
notebook?
Yes
No

All right! The Bombers Secret
Society of Justice forever!

Did you memorize the code?
If only you were human...then I
could make you a Bombers
member...Too bad!

You're pretty good for
a Deku Scrub!

If only you were human...

Then I could give you an original
Bombers' Notebook and make you a
member...

What do you guys think?

No way! No Scrubs!

I guess not...Once, we let some
kid who wasn't human join our
gang, and, boy, did we ever regret
it! Sorry!
But I'll teach you the code, just
like I promised. I can tell you only
once, though, so pay close
attention!
Are you ready?

The code is �!
The entrance to our hideout is in
East Clock Town!

Are you the guy who just popped
that up there?
Whoa!

Hey, just for you, guy, I can make
you a member of our gang, the
Bombers!

But there is a test for becoming
a Bombers member. C'mon!
Give it a try!

Are you ready?
Yes
No

If you can find all five of us by
tomorrow morning, I'll teach you
our secret code. Ready?

What's the deal, guy?
You dress like you think you're all
cool, but you're nothing special!

What? Whaddya mean?!
Don't you want to join the
Bombers?

Do you remember the code?
It's �!

Go to the secret hideout before
you forget it! It's in East Clock
Town!

Oh, what a cute little customer!
So, do you want to play?

Come in! Oh, is the kid collecting
masks? How about it? Wanna
play?

Well, aren't you a fit fellow!
Wanna play?

Well, hello there, handsome!
Wanna play?

For you, it's only 10 Rupees.
 
OK
No thanks

For you, it's 20 Rupees.
 
OK
No thanks

For you, it's 30 Rupees.
 
OK
No thanks

Hey...For you, it's only 5 Rupees.
 
OK
No thanks

Oh really? Too bad!
...Come again.

Oh really? Too bad!
...Come again.

Oh...really?

Oh, really? That's too bad! And
you're just my type, too...

If you can make it all the way to
the treasure chest and open it
within the time limit, I'll give you
a special prize.
Finding out what's inside is half
the fun!

Are you ready?

Did you have fun?

Oh, no...I'm sorry...
You don't have enough Rupees...

Umm...Won't you try again?

All right. Time's up!

You have strange powers, no?

Me been watching you!

Lately, this swamp, filled with
poison water.

Temple above waterfall strange...
Brother go to temple.

But brother no able to find temple
entrance. Temple for Deku only.

Brother captured by Deku. Now in
palace.

Help!

Was my brother all right?

Did you see entrance to cage?

We know secret route there.

Enter secret route from Outer
Garden entrance.

But entrance in tall place. No can
reach it.

Need bean from bean seller. Live
beneath palace garden.

Mmm...

Understand my meaning?
 
No
Yes

Mmm...so...

Oh! You smart.

Plant bean in soft place by
Outer Garden.

You figure out rest. Hurry. Help
brother.

Ah! You came! You came!

So? So?
You get?

Above is secret route I find. It
take you inside cage.

Mmm...
Follow me!

Mmm...
Follow me!

Mmm...
Follow me!

Link, I am truly thankful for
what you have done for the
princess.

As a sign of our gratitude, we
Deku have prepared something
that we think may assist you.
I will lead you to it.

From here, the pathways are dark
and can be quite treacherous...

Please follow closely and do not
get separated from me.

Well done, Link!

Now, here is the item I promised.
Please accept it.

Please follow me.

Actually, when I see
you, I am reminded of
my son who left home
long ago...
Somehow, I feel as if I am once
again racing with my son...

I am afraid I may have tried too
hard to outrun you. As old as I
am, I am still a fast competitor.
Just like when I raced my son...
Please forgive my rudeness.

Ah?!?
That mask...

It looks just like one my son used
to wear...

My son often used that mask to
find mushrooms in the forest. Oh,
how I long for those days.

I wonder where he has gone...what
he is doing...
If only he would write me a
letter...
Pardon me. Once again, thoughts
of my son have me feeling
sentimental. Now, where were we?

...Your Highness!
I am begging you! Please calm
down!

Now that our beloved princess is
missing, the king has been unable
to keep his cool...

I fear the princess may be caught
up in some kind of trouble, just
as that monkey claims...

But in his current state, the king
can't even send troops out to look
for her.
What are we to do?

It's terribly sad...
But nothing can calm the king
now....

Our swamps have become
poisoned...This may be the end of
the Deku Kingdom!

Oh, great lords! Save us!

Oh, great lords! Please save us!

We were about to punish an
innocent monkey!

More than anything, I'm just glad
the princess has returned safely.

Has the poisoned swamp been
cleared up?

That means we can now go to
those places we couldn't get to
before.

You can change into many things,
can't you? Very strange, indeed!

This is the palace of the Deku
Kingdom. Only those on official
business may enter!

...But you may enter to see the
public humiliation of the foolish
monkey who angered our king.

Follow this hall straight to the
Royal Chamber. Do not enter any
other areas whatsoever!

Did you come to see the
foolish monkey again?

You seem to enjoy seeing him!

Follow this hall straight to the
Royal Chamber. Do not enter any
other areas whatsoever!

I told you not to enter any areas
other than the Royal Chamber!

...It is a very rare occasion that
you are allowed to enter, so do
as I say!

Follow this hall straight to the
Royal Chamber. Do not enter any
other areas whatsoever!

This is the royal palace of the
Deku Kingdom. This is no place for
outsiders.

Pun-ish-ment!
Pun-ish-ment!

I saw it! That monkey and the
princess entering the temple at
night!
 
...But only the monkey came
back out!

Rumor has it that the
monkey ate the princess...

How frightful!

Only royal family members can
enter the sunken temple, so it's
obvious that the monkey was
using her!

The tiny princess only recently
learned to play the Deku Pipes...

His Royal Highness was so proud
of her...

Aha! An intruder!

Tee-hee-hee!
...Welcome.

My potions work very well,
they do.


...Are you, by chance,
a boat cruise customer?

How unfortunate. Koume has gone
into the woods out back, looking
for mushrooms...

Hmm...Now that I think about it,
she's a bit late coming back!

Say, could you go find her for
me?

Hmm, yes. It's easy getting lost in
those woods. Ask the monkeys
that live there.

What's that?!?
The Skull Kid got to Koume?!?

That's ridiculous...

If it's just the Skull Kid, then
what harm could he possibly do?

Oh!!
Well, if that's true, then take this
potion to her...
This isn't good...

Quick! Take that potion to her!

Oh! Did you give that potion to
Koume?
Don't tell me...
You didn't drink it all yourself, did
you?
.........

...Well, I'll be!
You're a hopeless child.
Next time, be sure you actually
give it to her!

Koume told me all about it!

Hmm...So, did you take the boat
cruise yet?

I just brewed up this cure-all!
It goes down easy and gets right
to work.

Blue Potion: 60 Rupees
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

Mmm...If only I had some fragrant
mushrooms...

I can't sell it to you if you have
nothing to keep it in!

Are you trying to play a trick on
me?!? You don't have enough
Rupees!

Take care...Tee-hee-hee!

Have you seen an old hag named
Koume who looks just like me?
She hasn't come back from
gathering medicinal herbs...

Gone out back to the woods on
a little errand.
            -Kotake
            The Manager

Tee-hee-hee!
...Hmm...Did you need me for
something?

I'm heading back to the potion
shop for now, so I'm counting on
you.

...Could you, by chance, be a boat
cruise passenger?

It's unfortunate, but Koume is
missing...

Help me look for her...

Koume!
Where are you?

Ah...hmm...Now that's a problem...
See, we sell potions to humans
only.

I don't think they'll work on
anything but humans...Sorry, but
you'll have to leave.

Ohh! Owow-ow!
Help meeee!

I was just busy minding my own
business, picking mushrooms,
when...
BAM! I got hit from behind!
That pesky Skull Kid!
Did he think an old hag wouldn't
recognize him if he hid his face?

Oh, ow! To think he's that
powerful...and now I can't even
move!

You! Don't you have anything that
gives you energy?

Ah! What is this?!
You're no help...

I say, you're not at all what you
make yourself out to be!

Ow-ow-yeow!
Don't you feel obligated to help a
sorry old hag when you see one?

Ooh!
Feel the energy flow!

Koume is revived!!!

You saved me!

I'm the swamp tour guide. I run
the boat cruise, so come by if
you want a free ride.

Oh! Thanks for what you did back
there!

In a special deal just for you, I'll
let you take this cruise for free.

If you're going on the boat cruise,
buy your ticket here.

...Umm...

Adults: 50 Rupees
Children: 10 Rupees
Group discounts for 15 or more...

So...going on the cruise?
Yes
No

Great. Kids are 10 Rupees!

Well, come see me if you change
your mind...

All right. Well, take care...

Well, welcome back. If you're ever
in the mood, come again...

Old Koume's Boat Cruise
Ticket office closed.

Please inquire at the Magic Hags'
Potion Shop near the edge of the
swamp.

Ah, yes, we've got a special going
on right now, so we're giving this
out for free!

Ah! That color! That smell...
That's definitely Kotake's...

Ack! Now I've done it! I've gone
and attracted some weirdo's
attention! Umm...I'll just play dead.

.........

Well, this is where the boat
cruise leaves from, but
unfortunately it's for humans only.

Oh! Thanks for what you did back
there!

As a special just for you, I'll let
you take this cruise for free.

Oh, but wait...Yes. Just as I
thought...

It seems the poison swamp has
been cleaned up, so why not try
something that's more interesting?

How about a little game?
I'll fly around on my broom, and
you try to hit my target?

Doesn't it sound fun?
Well, wanna try?
Sure
No thanks

Why not?!? You don't like to play
with us old folk?

Oh, I see how it is! If that's the
case, then shoo! Shoo!
Off you go!

Tee-hee-hee!
That's the way to go!

But let me explain!
You're not aiming for me with that
bow. You're aiming for the target!

If you hit me, I'll never forgive
you.

Ready?
Here we go!

Tee-hee-hee-hee!
So you do want to try?
The old hag sees all!

...Hmm...Let's see.

Ho! You again?
If you'd like to play that game,
it's 10 Rupees.

What'll it be?
 
I'll play
No thanks

Well, you do that then. You'll
never be an upstanding adult if
you don't challenge yourself.

Why, you don't have enough
Rupees! Don't you try to make
a fool out of me!

Your last record was
 hits.
If you get more than that, you'll
win a prize. 
Now, then. Here we go!

To shoot a pathetic old hag
10 times! I'd like to see your
parents' faces when they hear
of it!

� hits
Say...you're pretty good.

Well, as I promised...
Here! Take this.

It may be impossible to break this
record.

But if you want to try again, just
ask me!

Wow! That was sloppy!
� hits, eh...

Why don't you come back after
you practice up a bit!

Wow. That was sloppy!
� hits, huh?

You have to get more than  hits.
Otherwise, no prize.

�!
Pretty good, considering...

Well, as I promised...
Here! Take this.

Now wasn't that fun? If you'd like
to play again, come back and see
me...Tee-hee!

Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you aiming for, anyway?
That's it! We're done!

Blue Potion: 60 Rupees
Actually, I can't get the
ingredients for this, so I'm sold
out. Sorry.

What's that? You want a Blue
Potion, do you?

Well, you gave me a mushroom, so
I'll give you one for free.

Sniff, sniff...I think I'm smelling
the light fragrance of mushrooms... 
Do you have any?

Mmmm...What a scent!
Oh, you did a great job finding
this one!

I just haven't been able to get my
hands on any of them, and that
put me in a real pinch!

Well, I can use this to make
something, so come back later.

What I use this for is a trade
secret! Sorry, but you'll have to
come back later.

Long ago, this powerful nose of
mine could detect them wherever
they grew...

But lately my nose has lost its
touch...

It's tough getting old...

Mmm...
This mushroom smells nice, too.

I'll pay a fortune for it.
You must sell it to me!
Here!

Keep bringing 'em in!

If you have a mushroom, I'll buy it.

But next time you'll have to pay
for it. Oh...and don't tell Koume!

If you take a nice picture from
the boat, take it to that fella
over there.

All right...The boat's leaving!

Why, your bottle's already full!

I can't sell you any potions unless
you have an empty bottle!

What are you hangin' around for?
I hate slackers!

Oh! Aren't you wearing a fine
mask!

With that mask, you can find the
mushrooms that grow in the
woods.

Find a bunch and bring 'em here!

Everyone!
Hurry up and get that cauldron
ready!!!

I haven't seen your face before.
Are you visiting?

Usually, I don't allow the likes of
you in my Royal Chamber, but
today is different!

We're about to punish the foolish
monkey who kidnapped the Deku
princess!

He has insulted the Royal Family.
I'll show him what happens when
you do that!

That foolish monkey is up in that
cage. Take a good look at his
face!

How about that?
...Hot, isn't it?

The monkey shall suffer and
suffer 'til he can suffer no more!

You shall know the wrath of a
king whose darling princess was
taken away from him!!!

Suffer!
I shall prolong his suffering!
Foolish monkey!

Oh, my princess! My darling
princess!!! You are all right?
I was so worried.

Hasty decision making is my
weakness...This time, more than
ever, it has become clear to me.

Oh, strange traveler, there is
little I can do. Please rest a bit
before going.

Everyone, did you hear that?

This melody, which only the Deku
Royal Family knows...

It proves the foolish monkey
deceived the princess so he could
enter the temple!

Everyone!
Let the monkey's punishment
commence!

They keep saying that I kidnapped
her. No matter how many times
they say it, it's not going to bring
the princess back! 
If they're not careful, the princess
will fall victim to a monster!

Please, believe my words...

Oh! You...How did you get here?

Shhh!
If they see you, they'll capture
you!

What? My brothers asked for
your help? Ugh...I'm terribly
sorry...

Just try to cut my rope. We'll
talk after that!

What are you doing? Quick--cut
this rope!

Huh? That guy...
Where did he go???

Hmm...No good, after all!

Wait...You don't happen to have
something that can make a lot of 
noise...like a loud instrument with
sound that carries a long way?
If you have one, show it to me!

If you have one, show me! We
have to use it...

Please! An instrument that can 
blare out a lot of sound that'll
carry a long way!

That tiny thing will never do. Its
sound won't carry far enough...

Don't you have something else?

Hmm...That definitely makes noise...
but that's not it!

That's not it.
One with blaring sound that
carries even farther!

Huh? That guy...
Where did he go?

Oh! You have them! You do!
Just like the princess...
Deku Pipes!
Those will work great!!!

By the way...who are you?

By the way...who are you?

By the way...who are you?

...Whoa!
That's not important now...
Just listen to me!

I was trying to find out about the
poison in the swamp, so I went to
Woodfall Temple above the
waterfall.
But the temple had become a
monster's lair, and the princess
was captured by the monster...

Since the Deku king thinks I
kidnapped the princess, he won't
listen to a word I say.

Now the princess is in trouble, so
I must somehow hurry to the
temple and save her!

Do you understand my plight?
 
No
Yes

Then I will tell you and tell you
until it is clear to you!

So then, that means...

You will go in my place and save
the princess!

OK, now I'll teach you the melody
that opens the temple.

The princess taught it to me!
We can't let them hear us, so I'll
sing it softly...

You'd better take the shortcut the
Deku people use to get to
Woodfall Temple.

But you must hurry! If you don't,
I will be punished by the Deku
king!

I understand, Princess. Forget
about that. Has the temple been
returned to normal?

Really? So you're called
Link, are you?

Thank you for keeping your
promise to me.

Link, I'm sorry for all that
trouble.

Now it looks like we monkeys and
the Deku Scrubs can start getting
along again.

...You know, the swamp may be
back to normal, but something still
gives me a bad feeling...

I wonder what it could be?

Ooh! Hot! Hot!
St-stop it! Please!!!

They keep saying that I kidnapped
her. No matter how many times
they say it, it's not going to bring
the princess back!

.........

Why won't they believe what I
say?

...Fine! I get it! Then I shall say
nothing more to you! Punish me or
do whatever else you might!

I have nothing else to say to you
Deku Scrubs!
Do as you will!

Ah! Help me!
I am not a monster!

The spider's curse...
It made me this way...

I beg of you...In here...Find them
all...The gold ones...The cursed
spiders...Defeat them...Quickly!

And when you defeat them...
don't forget...the spider token...it
contains the spider's spirit...

If you lift the curse...I'll teach you
...something good...Hurry...Please
...This is awful...

In here...The gold ones...The cursed
spiders...Defeat them all...Make me
normal...again...

Make me...normal again...I'll teach
you something...something good...
Please...help me...

Ohhh! I've been saved! I thought
that I was going to die...

You see, a while back, someone
told me I could become rich and
he gave me this mask.

He said the instructions were
inscribed somewhere in here, but
when I went to look, I was
cursed!
If I had known it would be such
an ordeal, I never would have
taken it. Here! Take it!
It's yours!

I've had enough of this...

As soon as I get it together,
I'm going home.

Ohhh! I've been saved. I thought
that I was going to die...

You see, a while back, someone
told me that I could become rich
and he gave me this mask.

He said the instructions were
inscribed somewhere in here, but
when I went to look, I was
cursed!
If I had known it would be such
an ordeal, I never would have
taken it. I'm getting rid of it!

As soon as I calm down, I'm going
to get rid of it.

Rrr-ruff!
Stupid master...His eyes are
always filled with greed and
desire...

Rrr-ruff!
I've had it with this foolish
master...

What's a racing dog like me doing
in a place like this?

Oh, how I miss the ranch...

Well...chomp, chomp...
You're the first customer I've had
in a looooong time!

Do you need any Magic Beans?
They sprout leaves as soon as
you water them. That they do,
they do.

Mmm, I'll give you one free sample,
so try planting it in some soft
soil. You can always buy more.

Mmm...So you liked my Magic
Beans and came back to buy
more?

It's 10 Rupees for one pod.
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

Mmm...Well, if your mood changes,
come back and buy some.

Mmm...
You don't have enough Rupees.

You can plant 'em whenever you
want, but if you don't water 'em,
their leaves won't grow.

Mmm...
You can't carry anymore.

Wha?
...Who are you?

Link?
Pleased to meet you. I am the
Deku princess.

Were you, by chance, asked by
that monkey to come save me?

Aha! Just as I suspected!
You see, your body smells a little
bit like monkey.
 
So...the monkey made it back fine
after all. That's good.

I was worried that when I didn't
come home, my father would think
that monkey had kidnapped me!

I was worried that my father
would even go so far as to punish
the poor monkey!

Hoo-hoo-hoo.

......
Don't tell me...
Are you serious?!?S

Is father actually doing that?!?
Yet another hasty decision,
father!

W-Well, we haven't any time to
lose...

Quickly, Mr. Link, could you
please find something to carry me
in so you can take me to the
Deku Palace?

It's Mr. Link, correct?
You, sir, have strange powers,
indeed...

I don't mind tight places, so surely
you have something you can put
me in to carry me...

If you have anything at all, then,
by all means, take it out and use
it right here!

Hwh-Hwhy are you hwaiting?
Mr. Link!

Huh-Hurry! Ho-Hopen this bottle
and release me right hwh-hwhere
my father is standing.

H-Hufff-huhhh!
Foolish father!!!

WHAT are you doing?!?
Let that monkey go this instant!!

Oh, Mr. Monkey, I am truly sorry.
Father does such rash things
when he's worried about me.

Why yes, thanks to
Mr. Link here.
I am very, truly grateful.

As a symbol of our gratitude, our
butler has prepared a little
something for you.
Please accept it.
You'll find it in the shrine that
will be to your right when you
leave the palace.

It seems our butler has taken
somewhat of a liking to you,
Mr. Link.

I believe you'll find him waiting in
the shrine that will be to your
right when you leave the palace.

I shall never forget what you have
done for us.

But please forgive me if I refuse
to ride in that tiny, little bottle
ever again!

Ungh! Mr. Link!
There's nuh-no time to lose!
Huh-Hurry! Take me to the palace!

Blimey!
Where is he? That spoiled child is
off playin' hooky again!

A child his age has no business
searching for fairies...!

Oh! Ahem...Welcome!

Oh...The pictograph contest we're
holding is only for humans.
Sorry.

Well then, why don't you show me
the pictograph you've taken?

If you happened to come here to
show me a pictograph...I hate to
say it, but the contest has ended.

Ah! But I do hear the boat cruise
is starting up a new attraction,
so go to that window over there
and ask them about it.

Oh! You really captured the white
with this shot!

And these guys are quick, too!
This is a difficult shot!

Now then, please choose your
prize:
20 Rupees
Another boat cruise

Bring us another nice pictograph
if you can, all right?

You must really like that boat
cruise. All right...Off you go...

I hope you enjoyed it. Bring us
another nice pictograph again, 
all right?

Oh!
This is a Big Octo...

I'm pretty sure others have taken
pictographs of those before...

But if you get too close to one of
those things, it'll suck you in, so
it's pretty hard to take a decent
shot.

Hmm...That's kind of a standard
shot, don't ya think?

Well, it is a good shot...

All right...Choose your prize...
 
5 Rupees
Another boat cruise

You're a challenger, aren't you?
All right...Off you go...

Well, how was it? Did you take a
nice pictograph?

Don't give up. Come back again
with another picture.

Hey...You didn't take this
pictograph in the swamp, now did
you?

You can't enter the contest with
pictographs that weren't taken in
the swamp. It is a nice shot,
though...

Huh? Is this your first time
entering the pictograph contest?

Well, the Swamp Tourist Center is
currently holding a pictograph
contest.

It's open to all ages,
from children to adults.

For nice pictographs taken in the
swamp, a free boat cruise will be
awarded as a special prize.

So, would you like to enter our
contest?

Oh, but to enter, you first must
take the boat cruise.

Boat cruise reservations are
handled at that window over
there.

If you're interested, go for a ride.

Huh? Haven't you gotten a
pictograph box yet?

If you take the boat cruise, they'll
give you one for sure. Go ask at
that window.

We're running the pictograph
contest for a brief time only.

Welcome to the boat cruise.
Please set your pictograph box to
(C), then press (C) to look
through it.(Please enjoy the swamp scenery
to your heart's content.

Now arriving at Deku Palace.(The swampwater is poisonous
here, so please watch your step.

Are you disembarking?
Yes
No

Are you boarding?
Yes
No

Well, here's a problem. You haven't
taken any pictographs at all.
I can't accept this.

Wha!!! That's my son!
Eesh...Is he still doing that sort of
thing?

Urgh...How humiliating! This guy...
He's my son...

As old as he is, he's still doing
some pretty silly stuff.

I guess I spoiled him too much
when I was raising him...But he
really is a kindhearted boy.

Well, thank you for going to all
that trouble. This is just a small
token of my gratitude!

But could you tell my son
something for me?

...Could you, uh, please ask him
not to go outside in that outfit
anymore?

Oh!Oh!The king!
You are amazing!

If you're not a Deku Scrub, you're
not allowed to enter the Deku
Palace, but somehow you took this
picture...This is a great shot...

This is as rare as they come!
I'm giving you a big prize!

I'm looking forward to your next
picture!

Ahh...Welcome.
Our spring sale is now underway.

You'll lose out on a bargain if you
don't act now...

Huh? Darmani?

...Welcome.

Oh, but I'm sleepy...
Well, take your time anyway.

Push (+) left or right to view my
goods.
Talk to shopkeeper
Quit shopping

You must be tough to have made
it through the cold dressed in
just that outfit.

I can't get product stocked in this
cold. It's a real problem...

Sorry, but if you came to visit,
there's no one here. They've all
gone to the races.

You didn't go to the races?

10 Bombs: 40 Rupees
This is our standard product. But
we have only a few left.

10 Bombs: 40 Rupees
 
I'll buy them
No thanks

10 Arrows: 40 Rupees
These fly well, but you need a
bow. If you don't have one, you
can't buy them.

10 Arrows: 40 Rupees
 
I'll buy them
No thanks

Red Potion: 80 Rupees
It's a little expensive, but it's
worth it. It's very helpful if
you're feeling weak.

Red Potion: 80 Rupees
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

10 Bombs: 10 Rupees
These are selling well. They're a

When you're low on energy, this'll

Red Potion: 50 Rupees

I can't sell you this if you don't
have a bow.

You have to have something that
can hold bombs before I can sell
these to you.

You can't carry any more of
these.

I can't sell this to you if you
don't have an empty bottle to
keep it in.

Yeah, but you don't have enough
Rupees.

Thanks for your business.

Take care.

Hoo-Hoot!
We meet again, fairy child! Have
my stone statues been of help?

Well, it seems you may have the
strength to change the fate of
this land as I had expected.

But the road ahead is even more
challenging. Many trials await you.
Please watch over these Gorons
around you.
Their land is doomed to be
smothered in snow and ice
forever. It will become a land
where no living thing can survive.
Without courage and
determination, you surely will
collapse from the extreme 
conditions...

But if that courage and
determination burns bright within
you, then that's another story...

So, will you proceed?
Yes
No

Hoo-Hoot!
You are a child of many
strengths!

Well, perhaps you do have enough
strength to change the fate of
this mountain after all.

I shall take to the air now, flying
toward that shrine across the
way, so follow behind me.

Do not be daunted by
appearances. Instead, let your
feelings guide you, and the true
path shall open before you.

Are you ready?
Follow behind me!

I shall pass no judgment.
If that is your decision, then
return to town.

After retreat, courage returns.

What is it that you are doing?
Beyond here you will fall into 
oblivion unless you have great
courage and determination.

It seems things are not going well
for you...Hoo-Hoot! Fear not, it
never goes well at first for
anyone.
But by no means should you
grow impatient. Impatience brings
uneasiness and distracts the
heart.

Well, will you try again?
Yes
No

I see...
Then hurry back to town.
After retreat, courage will rise
again.

Very good. I shall fly toward that
shrine. Follow behind me.

Do not be daunted by
appearances. Instead, let your
feelings guide you, and the true
path shall open before you.

Hoo-Hoot!
I have certainly been assured of
your courage and determination.

From here on, you must not be
fooled by appearances. You must
rely on your feelings...

Now, enter the shrine. Something
that will aid you in your quest
lies within. Use that item when
returning from here.

Ho-ho-ho-ho-hoot!
This is a rare sight. You are a
fairy child, correct?

What business might you have in
this poisoned swamp?

If you dare not venture further,
I shall pass no judgment.
It is better that you hurry back
to town.

This swamp you are in has lost
its guardian deity. But it was
destined to fade anyway.

Hoo-hoot...And that destiny is not
solely limited to this swamp...

If you have the courage and
determination to proceed in the
face of destiny, then I shall teach
you something useful.

Before coming here, had you not
seen any of the stone statues
that bear close resemblance
to me?

I have placed those throughout
the land to aid the one with the
power to change the destiny of
this land...
Wherever he may appear.

If you have left proof of our
encounter on any of those stone
statues...

Then the song carved at my feet
will certainly be of some
assistance...

Remember it well and play it
wherever the need arises.

From the first time you play this
song, we shall become eternal
friends, transcending time and
place!

Notes are carved in the stone...

Ye who hold the sacred sword,
leave proof of our encounter.

You can save your progress and
quit here. When you
reselect your file, my face will
appear by your file name.
This indicates that the next time
you reopen your file, you'll resume
playing at this very place and
time with your current status.

Ugogh!
Ugor ugoh ughor?

Shaddup!

Just when I was having a good
dream...

Oh! Welcome to the Mountain
Smithy, where we take our time to
make a good point. I am Zubora,
the owner. Pleased to meet you.

Ugo-oh! Ugo ugo!

Shaddup over there!

That huge fellow is my assistant,
Gabora. He's all brawn and about
as smart as a Deku Stick.

Say...Did you come to have your
sword sharpened?

Unfortunately, we're not doing any
business right now. It's because of
this abnormal cold snap we've
been having.

See?
Our hearth has been frozen over!

The way things are going now,
I won't be able to do any business
until spring...

If I could just do something about
that frozen hearth...

Ugo-oh! Ugo, ugo!

Eh? What's that?

You say if we had hot water, we
could melt the ice off the hearth?

Don't act like you know what
you're talking about, you Deku
Stick!

Oh, he believes a rumor that says
long ago there were hot springs 
somewhere in the mountains near
here.
Bah! I don't believe such rubbish.

Ugoh-oh!
Ugoh ugo ugo?

Eeesh! You're so loud!

You've gotta understand, I have to
melt this ice off my hearth before
I can go to work.

Come back in the spring after the
ice melts.

Ugoh-ooooh!!!
Ugoh! Ugo-a-go-go!

Gabora!!!

Huh?

Oh!
You've done me a great favor!
Now, then...

This hearth can finally go to work
for me!
Heh-heh-heh-heh...
Thanks.

Ugoh-oh!
Ugoh ugo ugo?

Oh, a customer?

Sorry, but we do only swords and
cutlery.

Sorry, but we do only swords and
cutlery.

Sorry...It would take until
tomorrow morning to sharpen your
sword, and we're not taking any
more orders today.
...Why, you ask? Because
tomorrow is the town's carnival,
and you can't work during the
carnival, can you?

Gabora, fetch our customer some
coffee, quick-like.

Now then, let me take a look at
your sword.

Hmmm...

All right...To reforge your sword,
it will cost you 100 Rupees. It'll
be ready at sunrise.

You'll have to let us hold onto
your sword until then.

Keep in mind that after you use
your reforged sword 100 times, it
will lose its edge and it'll be back
to its original sharpness...
So, would you like your sword
reforged for 100 Rupees?
I'll do it
No thanks

Oh, really? Then it can't really be
helped. Drop by again sometime.

Gabora, forget about the coffee!!

This is a secret, but I'll let you in
on it...If you bring me some gold
dust, I can forge you the
strongest of swords...
It'll never lose its edge. It's the
strongest. The strongest...

Reforge your sword?
Yes
No thanks

Huh? You don't have 100 Rupees?

Gabora...
Say goodbye to the customer.

And we just got the ice melted
off the hearth and everything...

Thanks for dropping in. Now then,
I'm straight off to work!

Come back tomorrow morning.

Ugoh ugo ugo!

Your sword will be ready tomorrow
morning. We'll take good care of
it, so don't worry.

Hey, now that's a mean joke. Your
sword has already been reforged
into a Razor Sword!

Unless...
Do you want me to make your
sword stronger?

To do that, I'll need gold dust.
Do you have any?

Why, if it isn't gold dust! And it's
even top quality!!!

Why, even if I use it to reforge
your sword, there'll still be some
left...

All right! Just for you, I'll do this
for free. But don't tell anyone!

Huh? That's not gold dust.

...You can't get your hands on it
that easily, you know!

Ugoh-ugo-ugo!

What? What?!? You say that
gold dust is the prize for winning
the Patriarch's Race that's held by
the Gorons every spring?

What if you tried entering that?

To make your sword any stronger,
I'll need gold dust, which just so
happens to be first prize at the
Goron racetrack.
If I can just get some gold dust...
and this is just between us...I can
make you the strongest of
swords. The strongest...

Hey! Hey! Take it easy!
Your sword is already as strong
as I can make it!

It's impossible to make it any
stronger. It doesn't matter how
much gold dust you pack in
there!

But...
If you have gold dust, I'll buy it
off you for 40 Rupees.
How about it?

Huh? Look, I'm working on
strengthening your sword. I'm
busy, so don't bother me.

Grrr...You're persistent...
I can't focus on my work! Just
wait until morning!

I kept you waiting...
But it's done! See?

Now keep in mind that after
you've used this 100 times, the
blade will lose its edge and will
return to its original sharpness.
Now here's a secret...If you bring
me gold dust before this sword
loses its edge, I'll be able to make
it the strongest sword around.
You got that? Gold dust!

Ugoh!
Ugoh ugo ugo!

There it is. We can't make a
sword stronger than that.

No matter how many times you
use it, it will never lose its edge.
Try it.

Oh, I used up most of the gold
dust. Just a tiny bit was left, so
I got rid of it for you.

Ugo-oh!
Ugoh ugo ugo!

Thanks for dropping in!
You got a great deal.

If you get any more quality gold
dust, you'll sell it to me, right?

What? You're telling me that's
not enough? No way. That's the
going price. The going price!

No one else will buy it for this
much...

So, come on...Will you sell it for
40 Rupees?

I'm the Goron who sells the
Powder Keg, the most famous
product of the Gorons.

Want a Powder Keg?
Powder kegs explode with powerful
blasts and are very dangerous...

Until I have tested you to see if
you can use them properly, I can't
let you use any on your own.

Will you give it a try?
Yes
No

If you can destroy the boulder
that blocks the entrance to the
Goron Racetrack near here...

using the Powder Keg I'm about
to give you, then I'll approve you
to carry them.

When the Powder Keg begins 
ticking faster, it means that it's
about to explode.

Try to blow up the boulder
blocking the Goron Racetrack
entrance without the Powder Keg
exploding on the way.
There's a sign near the racetrack,
so keep an eye out for it. When
you've finished, come see me.

Come back if you change your
mind.

It looks like you managed to
succeed! Knowing your skills, I
feel fine letting you handle Powder
Kegs on your own.
It was bad of me to put you
through such a dangerous test. I
want you to take this as my
apology.

Powder Kegs are very
volatile, so you can carry only one
at a time.

If you shoot them with an arrow,
they'll explode as soon as they're
hit, so be careful.

You failed?
In that case, I can't approve you
to use Powder Kegs.

Will you take the challenge again?
Yes
No

If you change your mind, see me.

You can carry only one Powder
Keg at a time. Once you've used
it, come back.

Will you a buy a Powder Keg for
100 Rupees?
I'll buy it
No thanks

If you change your mind, see me.

I'm the Goron who sells Powder
Kegs, the most famous product of
the Gorons.

But the rules say I can't sell
Powder Kegs to anyone who isn't
a Goron. Sorry.

The rules say I can't sell Powder
Kegs to anyone who isn't a Goron.
Sorry.

What in the world have I been
doing this whole time?

Why am I sitting in a place like
this?

Darmani!
What in the world have I been
doing this whole time?

I can't remember a thing since I
went out to look around Snowhead
to figure out why spring wasn't
coming...

What am I doing sitting in a place
like this???

It's a good thing that spring
came...Give my regards to the
Goron Elder.

.........
Can it be? Are you able
to see me?

If you truly can see me, then
follow behind me...

The soaring one said the one who
could see me would be arriving
soon...

It seems that it turned out to be
true.

I am Darmani the Third.
The blood of proud Goron heroes
runs in me.

This feels strange for me to say,
but when I was alive, I was a
renowned warrior and veteran.

Yes...When I was alive...

But alas...
I am now dead.

I was fine until I marched off to
Snowhead by myself, hoping that
I could drive off a demon.

It had been wreaking havoc on
Goron Village...Then the blizzard at
Snowhead blew me into the valley.
...And now...Here I am...

...How infuriating!

As I am, I can only watch as
Goron Village is slowly buried
in ice...I may have died, but I
cannot rest.

So, you can use magic? The
soaring one also told me that you
are able to use it... 

I beg you! Bring me back to life
with your magic!

If it is beyond your power, then
I beg of you to do this for me
instead...

Heal my sorrows. Any way that
you can do it will suffice...
Please...heal my sorrows.

Medicine works only on the
living. It will do me no good.

Please...Just heal my sorrows. You
need not bring me back to
life.

I know you can do this for me as
you are right now. I beg of you.
Heal my sorrows.

What a soothing melody...
My sorrows are melting away into
the song.

I leave my undying feelings
with you...

The deeds I accomplished while
living are carved on my grave.
You should read it.

For the Goron Village...
I have asked your assistance...

It is written in letters you have
never seen before.

The Goron hero, Darmani the
Third, rests here.

In honor of a great hero, this
memorial is inscribed with the
knowledge of a great hero.

Will you read the knowledge
imparted by the hero?

 
Techniques for action
Techniques for battle
Don't read

Oh, chosen Goron hero!
Your power to lift objects without
effort is mightier than the
strength of any other.
And your heart is strong, too, as
it is filled with compassion that is
kinder than any other.

Goron heroes press (A) and (+)
so that they may curl up and roll
wherever it is that they may need
to go.
If Gorons who possess magic
power roll swiftly enough, spikes
will emerge from their bodies so
that they may mow down enemies.

Water is disastrous for Goron
heroes, for they sink like stones
and are rendered motionless in
the deep. Beware.

The powerful punch that Goron
heroes unleash by pressing (B)
is feared by all.

By repeatedly pressing (B), Goron
heroes will deal out a barrage of
punches.

After using (A) to curl up, a 
Goron can jump with (B) and
land with quaking impact that is
so mighty it can flatten enemies.

I wish someone would do
something...

Urrrgh...
I can feel it pounding in the back
of my head.

...Darmani?
You're alive?!

The Goron Elder said you had
died...
Was that a lie?

Whatever the case may be,
welcome back...

So...does that incessant crying
sound familiar to you?

The Goron Elder's son won't stop
crying.

Ahhh...
He finally quit crying.

But there's nothing to stop him
from crying again...

In weather this cold, even I want
to start crying...

The crying stopped, but it's
still c-c-cold...

It's Darmani!
You were always good at calming
the Elder's son.

Now...
The next thing we have to do is 
something about the torchlights
in this room.

It'd be nice if we could do
something about the torchlights,
but...

In this cold, we can't even get a
fire going. What should we do?

Oh!
The chandelier!!!

So this is how it works.
I had no idea.

I think it somehow got a little
warmer...

Ohhh...
I can feel it pounding in the back
of my head! 

Oh! Darmani!
You're alive...

This is wonderful!
But there's no time for catching
up...If something isn't done right
now about that crying...

...Look at this!
The torch that was just lit has
gone out.

Ugh! Again with that terrible
crying...

If this crying doesn't stop, the
torches will never get lit.

Hooo...
You saved me.

To think that his crying can put
out a torch...

That's the Goron Elder's son for
you.

I'm just glad the torchlights are
back to normal. Now it should be
a little warmer in here.

Hooo...That helped.
The torchlights are back to
normal.

You look like you're doing fine
despite all this noise.

I can feel it in my gut. It's
echoing in my empty stomach!

Wha!!! You're Darmani!
You're supposed to be dead!

Is that crying getting to me that
it has my eyes playing tricks on
me?

If this keeps up, I'll really go
crazy...

Thank heavens!

Was the Elder's son crying
because he was hungry?

There's nothing we can do.
It's gotten so cold in the
mountains...

we just can't seem to get our
hands on any of our food...

At this rate, everyone will go
hungry and die.

But I have an emergency supply of
food hidden away, so I'll be fine...

It's a good thing I hid some food
before it got cold.

...But it's a secret.

Whaa! The crying's stopped, but
there's still something wrong with
my eyes.

He's supposed to be dead...
yet I see Darmani standing right
before my own eyes.

...It is you.

Y-you can have the food I hid in
chandelier up there, so p-please,
j-just die in peace.

Aiee!

Y-you can have the food I hid in
the chandelier up there, so
p-please, j-just die in peace.

It's cold...

Being the gatekeeper in this cold
is h-h-hard.

Do you want to enter the Goron
Shrine?
Yes
No

Then I'll open the door with a
Goron Pound.

I'm going to close it right away so
it doesn't get cold inside, so hurry
up and get in.
Are you ready?

Are you sure?
It's a little bit warmer inside.
Ohhh, I want to go in, too.

The door's already open.
I'm going to close it right away,
so hurry up!

You're Darmani! How?
You're alive?!

Do you want me to open it again?
Yes
No

Whoa-oh-oh!!!

Up here! Up here!

I am sorry to bother you from
such a high place...

But I am very hungry, and I have
gotten stuck here.

Ooooh...It is so cold...
I am so very hungry. I don't think
I'm going to make it...

I just want to eat once more
before I die up here.
Something tough and hard to
chew...
I cannot forget that flavor...

I am quite thankful, but...

I cannot eat something like this...

Th-That's it! It's so good that I
dream about it...
Dodongo Cavern's finest quality
rock sirloin!

This is my absolute favorite!
Blessed be this meal!

Ohhhhhhh!!!
My energy has returned to me!

I am coming down now.
Wait one moment!

Oh!
I wondered who it might be.

Why if it isn't Darmani!
You are...alive?

...Yes, I see.
That is the reason why you knew
my favorite food.

Oh, I almost forgot. Please accept
this as a token of gratitude...

Thanks to you, my energy has
returned.

This is a token of my gratitude.
Please accept it.

It was crafted so well that no
one would even think twice if you
were to direct the frog choir.

I hope that spring will come soon
so that I can hear the frogs'
enthusiastic performance.

Hope as I might, it's still cold.
I'm going back to Goron Village...

Truthfully, I thought of giving you
this mask that I am wearing...

But one can never have too many
Rupees.

Too much cold is another story.
I'm going back to Goron Village.

I have been waiting for you, Don
Gero.

Forgive me if I'm mistaken, but it
looks like you've lost a little
weight...

As you can see, Don Gero, the
long winter has ended and spring
has finally come to these
mountains.

Let us begin our chorus.

Unfortunately, it seems not all of
our members have gathered.

Perhaps it is because winter was
too long? They must not have
realized that spring has come to
the mountains...

And when the great Don Gero has
come for us, too...What a pity.

Where in the world could the
other members be, and what could
they be doing?

The conducting was spectacular.
And all of our members rose to
the occasion!

This is how deeply we were moved
by your spectacular conducting...

Let us do it again sometime.

Well, if it isn't the great Don
Gero.

Shall we sing once again?
Yes
No

Ah! Don Gero!
It has been so long.

What has brought you all this
way?

Could it be...
Has spring finally come to the
mountains?

That look...It is true!
Winter was so long that I began
to lose all hope.

I understand.
I shall head for the mountains
immediately.

Could it be...
You came all this way looking for
me?

Ah! You need not say a thing.
Upon seeing that face,
I understand!

...Is it true?
But I had heard that it was still
winter in the mountains...

When spring comes, I shall
definitely go to the mountains,
so...
Let us meet again!

Hello?
You are Don Gero!!!
It has been so long!

Just as you instructed, I came
here to start up the frog's choir
as soon as spring arrived.

But spring doesn't seem to be
coming and none of the choir have
gathered!

To make matters worse, I grew so
hungry I could not move and found
myself in quite a fix.

I shall return the Rupees you gave
me, so permit me to go back to
the Goron Village.

I apologize for not being able to
keep my promise!

Hunh? What was I doing?

Ah!
It's already this late?!?
I must hurry!

Hunh?
You're one we don't see around
here much. Have you some
business with an Elder like me?
Hmm...But I haven't the time to
join you!

What?
You want to know what has me so
rushed?

It's this cold snap brought on by
the disturbances at Snowhead that
has crippled the village and frozen
it in an icy grip...

It's the lack of goods and
supplies that is leading to the
depopulation of Goron Village.

And above all, it's the image of
my own poor son, crying
continually because of this biting
cold.

As the Elder, I must do something
about the situation the village has
been plunged into.

But this is our problem!
We shall not rely on the strength
of strangers...
Kah!...Kah!...KOFF!
Mmmph...

This is our problem!
We will not rely on the strength
of strangers.
Kah!...Kah!...KOFF!

Hunh???

Oh! You're Darmani!!!

But you're supposed to be dead!
Am I hallucinating?

Maybe this is also the doing of
Snowhead's magic power...

Hmmph...
I've been made a fool of!

But...that's impossible. I refuse to
flinch. If I can see past the
illusion, you'll vanish in an
instant!

No matter how long you follow me,
it's not going to do you any good.

...What?

My son is crying because he
misses me??

Why do you know that?

My son misses me...

Ulp! Forgive me, my child!
Your father has work to do!

Darmani...
Be you a ghost or a figment of
my imagination, I no longer care.

If you feel pity for my crying
son...

then please quietly sing my son to
sleep with this song I am about to
play on my drum.

It is the very same melody that
was often played for you when
you were young...

It's not that I forgot it. It's just
so cold that I can't play very
well...

...At any rate, I am counting on
you.

Huh?

...Let me play it once more.

I am counting on you to take care
of my son!

How does this song go?

Umm...

Ah, yes, yes! Like this!

It's no good!
I can remember only the
beginning!

Oh! Welcome to spring in Goron
Village!

You're just in time...
We're holding the Goron Races in
celebration of spring, so go see
them!

Oh! Darmani!
I've been waiting impatiently for
you.

I have been waiting for your
arrival ever since I heard the
news...

I had heard that you, the one
whom I once thought to be dead,
had sealed off the blizzard that
was blowing in from Snowhead.

Thanks to you, spring has come
to Goron Village. Everyone is
pleased!

The greatest Goron hero of all?
That's...

Darmani!

The immortal Goron who
is not dead, even if he has died?
That's...

The star whom we wish upon?
That's...

Darmani, greatest of Gorons!

Greatest of Gorons!

Darmani is the greatest in the
world!!!

Greatest in the world!

My son got better immediately.
He went to see the Goron Races
that celebrate spring.

This time, I, the protector of this
tribe for so many years, choose
to yield the seat of tribal
patriarch to a younger one.

The Goron who makes calm
decisions, yet boasts courageous
determination and can take care
of all shall be the patriarch!

The chosen one, Darmani...
is you! There could be no other!

...What do you think? If it's you,
everyone would happily accept you
as the patriarch.

What? You need not answer so
quickly. Go, enter the Goron Race.
Think it over slowly. I am awaiting
a thoughtful response.

Come back to me with your
decision after you have entered
the Goron Race and thought about
it carefully.

My son should be anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

Now, quickly go beyond the Twin
Islands Cave after leaving Goron
Village.

Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. Please go see the Goron
Races held in honor of spring. 

Darmani!
The Goron Elder has been waiting
impatiently for you!

Darmani!
Are you going to enter the Goron
Races, too?

I'm going right away, too, so leave
some prizes for me.

Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. It's just starting to get
comfortably warm. It feels nice.

Darmani!
The Goron Elder has been waiting
impatiently for you!

Darmani!
You really are alive!

I'm feeling like a complete fool. 

Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. Bombs, the Goron's special
product, are now cheap, so you
should go buy some.

Darmani!
The Goron Elder has been waiting
for you!

Darmani!
You did it!

That's just like you to pretend to
be dead just so your enemies will
let their guard down.

Do you already have bombs,
the special product of the
Gorons?

There's a Goron in this village who
sells Powder Kegs, which are much
more powerful explosives.

If you're interested, you should
drop by Goron Village Cave.

Darmani!
The Goron Elder is waiting
impatiently for you!

Darmani!
So you're alive after all!

I was so completely fooled that
I even made a grave for you.
I'm so dumb.

Spring has finally come to Goron
Village. Now we can dig up the
rock sirloin that had been beneath
the ice.

But that has nothing to do with
you. Sorry.

Darmani!
The Goron Elder is waiting
impatiently for you!

Darmani!
You...You are alive.

You always did say, "I cannot die
until I've eaten 1000 tons of rock
sirloin!"

You...Do you know much
about the moon?

It's just that, lately, I think the
moon has been getting bigger.
I couldn't help but notice it. What
do you think?

Darmani!
The Goron Elder is waiting
impatiently for you!

Darmani, you sure are amazing,
but...

But somehow...I still have a bad
feeling about things...

You...You feel it too, don't you?

It's spring! It's spring!
I can't sit still any longer!

Darmani! Are you ready? I'm rarin'
to go!

Spring has finally come!
I have been waiting for this
moment.

This year is my debut at the
races...Please go easy on
me!

Since it has warmed up...
my spirits have lifted!

This year, I'm feeling a little
different...

Watch my race!

Darmani!
Are you entering after all?
...I guess I'll be last again.

This is the grave where a Goron
hero rests.

I came here to put up the great
hero's memorial...

But the return route has been
blocked by snow, and I can't get
back to Goron Village.

And even worse, my brother has
been frozen solid from the cold.

The way things are looking, I'll be
frozen, too.

Ohhhh...It's times like this that
make me wish I had taken some of
the hot spring water I found when
I was digging the hero's grave.

But the hot spring is now covered
by the gravestone. I can't move a
gravestone that big by myself.

But I guess this is what's meant
by the Goron saying, "There's no
use in crying over split rocks."
...Brrrrrr.

H-h-hooo. If only I had water from
the hot spring beneath the great
hero's grave...then I could melt the
ice off of my brother.

Y-you're...No! No, you're not
the great Darmani, are you?

Then...just whose grave was I
making?

Did you come back to life
because it was so warm beneath
your grave?

There used to be a hot spring
bubbling beneath the great
Darmani's grave.
 
If I had some of that hot spring
water, I might be able to thaw out
my frozen brother.

Hunh?
What have I been doing?

Oh!!! Are you all right, brother?
You were frozen, but the great
Darmani saved you!

The great Darmani?!
What's with you? Are you half
asleep?

Did you hear this guy?
The great Darmani died long ago
and is lying in his gr...

Heeee!!! Darmani!

I was shocked, too.
But somehow, it seems the great
Darmani isn't dead.

R-Really?

With this, a star of hope appears
in Goron Village.

Great Darmani! Please do
something about the blizzard
blowing in from Snowhead!

Oh! Are you all right, brother?
You were frozen and this person
saved you!

Frozen?!
...I was?

...Really? I don't know who you
are, but thank you!

But besides that, it turns out the
great Darmani is alive!

What's this?

I was shocked, too, but somehow
it seems the great Darmani is not
dead.

Really?
If that's true, then a glimmer of
hope has appeared in Goron
Village.

It's true! Surely the great
Darmani can do something about
the blizzard that blows in from
Snowhead.

Great Darmani!
Hurry! Please do something about
the blizzard blowing in from
Snowhead.

Great Darmani!
Have you seen the Goron Elder
yet?

If you haven't, you should go see
him soon. I'm sure he'll be very
happy.

Do you know the great
Darmani? He is the greatest hero
of the Goron tribe. He is our
last hope.

Have you seen the great
Darmani? No one can withstand
his punching and pounding.

H-h-hoooo...It's cold.
This cold has me hallucinating
about Darmani. I can't take it.

H-h-hoooo...It's cold.
This cold has me seeing Darmani's
ghost...Y-Yikes...
I th-think I'll go freeze again...

Thank you for saving my brother.

But something has to be done
about this cold. Otherwise, we'll
be Goronsicles.

H-h-hoooo...It's cold.
I wonder if we'll ever be able to
return to Goron Village.

This is great.
The Elder's son has finally quit
crying. Now we can sleep, too.

We're at our wits' end...

The Elder went to Snowhead and
doesn't seem to be coming back.
Now his son is so lonely that he
won't stop crying.

It keeps getting colder outside,
and inside we're so cold we could
freeze.

Those sideburns...Aren't you
Darmani? You're supposed to be
dead...but you're alive?

The Elder was troubled because he
thought you were dead.

I'm troubled, too...

The Elder went to Snowhead and
hasn't come back, so now his son
is so lonely he won't stop crying.

If you don't find the Goron Elder
and ask him to come back...I'll
never be able to sleep.

And it just keeps getting colder
outside...Even in here it is so cold
that we could freeze.

At his age, the Elder couldn't
have gotten very far.

I fear that he may be frozen out
there...

This is nice.
The Elder's son has finally stopped
crying. Now we can sleep, too.

This is the room of the Goron
Tribe's Elder.

Do you have some kind of
business with the Elder?
Unfortunately, he's out.

Since the Elder is gone, his son
won't stop crying. I wish someone
would do something...

Those sideburns...Aren't 
you Darmani? You're supposed to
be dead...but you're alive?
What have you been doing?

Thinking you were dead, the Elder
went to Snowhead on his own...

But for now, please go see the
Elder's son. Hurry!

The Elder's son is in there.
...This crying is heartbreaking.
Will it ever stop?

This store is having trouble
getting product because of the
cold. Things are kind of expensive
now, so you shouldn't shop here.

Waaa...Hunh, ugh...u-waahhh!
Da-daaaddy, daaaddy! Hunh...
I'm cooooold...Daaaddy!

...Hyunh, hunh...
Ahh, Darmi, where's my daddy?
Where's my daddy?

Waaah...Henh, uwaaaaah...
Daaaaaddy, daaaddy...H-hunh...
I'm cooold, Daaaddy!

That song...That's the song daddy
always plays for me before I
go to sleep...
I'll sing the next part.

Mmmmm...
It's just like...daddy's...
right...beside me...

Zzzzz...

Ah, Darmi!

Now that it's nice and warm out,
I'm much, much better.

Even if my daddy isn't right beside
me, I won't be selfish and cry.

So...now that spring has come, the
Goron Races should be starting
soon.

But...

But this rock is in the way, so I
can't get in to see the race...

And spring's just started, too...
I was so excited...but there's
nothing I can do...

I hate it! I hate it!
I wanna see it!
I wanna see it!
I wanna see the race!

Break it! Break it!
I wanna go to the race!
I wanna go to the race!

Did you come to play?

If you can, you should go see the
Goron races that are gonna be
held on the other side of this
mountain.

Way to go, Darmi!
That was cooool!

C'mon! If we don't hurry, the race
will start. C'mon! Hurry!

The Goron Races that honor the
coming of spring are about to
begin.

It's a really, really cool race, so
you should watch it.

Once you see these Goron races,
you'll wish you were born a Goron.

Ah! Darmi!
I've been waiting for you.

See, everyone's restless 'cause
they can't wait to enter. You're
gonna enter, aren't you?

You're gonna enter aren't you?
 
Yep
Nope

...You used to like racing more
than you liked gobbling up a third
helping of rock sirloin...

The Darmi I know would never
back out of a race...

I hate it!
I wanna watch you race!
I wanna! I wanna! I wanna!

...You really do want to race.
I know you do.

You have to! I want to show
everyone how Darmi races!

If your magic power runs low,
charge it up with the green jars
on the course.

That was great!
I knew you were the fastest
Goron, Darmi!

I was sure you'd get first place!

This is from daddy...
It's the prize.

I wanna be just like you--quick!

...You're just a little stiff because
winter was so long.

You're not really like this.

Remember how good you really
are, then enter the races again.

Oh, but if you don't have an
empty bottle to keep the prize in,
you can't enter...

Everyone, one entrant made a
false start, so we must restart
the race.

Can you hear me, Darmi? Umm...
I'm sorry, but there's no way you
can win now...

Do you want to keep racing
anyway?
Of course!
No...

C'mon...Enter the race.
I want to show everybody how
fast you are.

You did it!
Thanks a lot!

I'm going right in. I'll be waiting
for you, so you have to come
see it!

They're late!
What are those Zoras doing?

Hmm? What is it, boy?
Did you also come to watch the
Zora eggs hatch?

I'm excited about it, too, but
those important eggs haven't
arrived yet...

It takes about one to three days
from the time Zora eggs are laid
for them to hatch.

But if they aren't kept in this
aquarium until then...they may die.

The reason for this is that the
recent abnormal weather has
caused the ocean temperature to
rise in this region.
Zora eggs are very sensitive to
changes in the temperature.
The only way the eggs can hatch
is if they're placed in this
aquarium water, which I set aside
for them long ago.

The Zoras are well aware of
this, but they're still late.
I wonder if something has
happened at Zora Hall?

They're late!
What are those Zoras doing?
If they don't hurry, the eggs will
die.

This is a problem. Zora eggs won't
hatch unless all eggs that were
laid at the same time are brought
together.
What are those Zoras doing?

What are you doing here? You
look a little out of place at the
ocean, don't you think?

The seas around here are too
warm and aren't suitable for you
to splash around in.

If you don't have any business
here, then be on your way.

These seas are too warm for you
to splash around in. If you haven't
any business here, then be on
your way.

And besides, the more I think
about it, the funnier it looks
seeing a fellow like you at the
ocean.

What are you doing? Don't you at
least shut your mouth when you're
listening to people?

The seas around here are too
warm and aren't suitable for you
to splash around in.

If you don't have any business
here, then be on your way.

These seas are too warm to
splash around in. If you haven't
any business here, then be on
your way.

Are you really getting what I'm
saying to you when you just stand
there with your mouth wide open?

What happened to the rest of the
eggs? The eggs can't hatch if
they aren't all together.

Hurry! Find the rest of the eggs
and put them in the aquarium.

Oh, you finally came? I've been
waiting for you. What about the
eggs?

I heard there is a total of seven...
Hurry! Put them in that aquarium.

If you don't hurry, the eggs will
die. Quickly! Put them in that
aquarium!

Good. All of the eggs have been
brought together.
...It's going to start. Quick! Come
to the front of the aquarium!

L-look at this! What does this
mean...What in the world could
this mean?

...I've got it!

Don't you understand? The way
these Zora children have lined
up...It means...

You...Don't you have some kind of
instrument?

......
Nothing. Not a thing. Could it be
you're using the wrong
instrument?

That! Yes, it's that instrument!

Hmm...
If these Zoras were born to teach
this song, then hurry!

You must play this song for the
Zora who laid these eggs!

I will take good care of the Zora
children. You go find the Zora
who laid these eggs! Quickly!

...This is a very strange thing.

If Zora children can teach music,
then the Zora still hold many
mysteries.

What happened?
Just what kind of song was that?

You must know something, don't
you?

I don't understand what happened,
but it seems the ocean has
reclaimed its serenity.

Could this somehow be related to
that song? You know something,
don't you?

The ocean's temperature has
returned to normal. Did you come
here to splash around in the sea?

If you drown trying to swim with
a big ol' body like that, don't
blame me!

The ocean's temperature has
returned to normal. Did you come
here to spash around in the sea?

If you try swimming with that
puny body, you'll be sorry!

If they don't hurry, the eggs will
soon die. What could the Zoras be
doing?

Unghhh...
Somebody...

Unghh...
Please...

G-gu-hu...
Get me...

...to shore...

Uuungh...I am Mikau of the Zora
people......guitarist in the Zora
band...

I think this is it for me...
My final message...

...Will you listen to it?
 
I'll listen
I won't listen

One! Two! Three!!!

Oh, baby, baby, listen to me!
The carnival's beginning soon.
We're the ones they're waiting to
see.

But that girl, our vocalist...
She laid some strange eggs.
And she's lost her voice,
You can't hear what she says.

Whoa-oh! In Great Bay now
somethin' is a-happenin'.
Is it now?

Oh! Baby, listen to me.
I don't wanna beg.
Gerudo Pirates!
They stole that girl's eggs.

I went to stop the Gerudo Pirates,
then pow and bam!
I got knocked down,
and here I am!

Baby! If I die like this...
Even if I die...
It won't be in peace...
That's for suuure!

Somebody, please rescue her eggs
before the pirates take their toll.
Oh, somebody, somebody,
please heal my soul.

That's all...
Thank you!

Gugh-hunh...
M-my eyes...Everything's all hazy...

Soon, I'll be just another wave in
the ocean...destined to disappear.

Oh, yeah! That hot sound shoots
right to my heart.

Carve my farewell song on my
grave...
I'm depending on you to help that
singer girl...

Herein lies Mikau, the legendary
guitarist of the Zora tribe. He is
to be remembered in song, and his
lyrics are written here.

Will you try to sing Mikau's
lyrics?

 
1. We the Zora
2. Zora Fight Song
I won't sing

Sharp fins are the mark of the
Zora. We swim, speeding through
the seas with (A) and (+).

If � is pressed when swimming,
a shield is produced to deflect
enemies.
(Spoken) If you have magic.
We can even dive by pressing (B)!
Oh-oh...We the Zora.

For my punch of anger, hit
(B). Press (B) repeatedly for a
flurry of attacks! Yeah, yeah.

For my deadly move, press and
hold (B). Now release! It's the
final blow. My double cutters!

Lulu's Diary

It has been two days since I have
lost my voice.

I don't want Mikau to know, so I
talked to Evan about it.

He recommended that I take the
eggs to the Marine Research Lab
to have them checked.

I think I will take them right
away.

Such a terrible thing has happened
today that I don't even know
where to begin writing.

I heard a sound late at night, and
when I opened my eyes, I saw
strangers in my room.

I tried to fight, but they were
able to steal my precious eggs.

It seems I lost consciousness
after that.

Today, I told everything to Mikau,
the one person whom I didn't
want to know about it.

At first, I was too embarrassed
and too sad to do anything.

And with the words that Mikau
said at that moment, I felt that
all hope had been lost.

But please, Mikau, I'm begging you,
don't do anything rash.

.........

That sad face is trying to tell you
something.
...You can see it in her
expression!

Mikau, what's going on?

And my voice...

What happened to me?

Who are you?
Mikau...Where's Mikau?

Mm...Mm...Yeeeaaawn!
I slept quite well!

I just realized this when I opened
my eyes. The passing of days is
quite quick. Isn't it, Lulu?

Yes, Lulu. It's nothing to be
surprised at.

Although my eyes were closed in
sleep, I still see everything that
occurs in this ocean...

...Hmm.
It seems Lulu is confused.
Regrettably, there is no time for
idle conversation.
Now then, proud Zora warrior...

The open seas of Great Bay have
need of your might.

Quickly. Climb onto my back.

Why so slow?
Hurry up and fire your hookshot
into the palm tree on my back,
Link.

Heh, heh, heh.
Of course I know your name.
Didn't I say that all is seen by
me?

You seem to be having a bit of
trouble...

Are you still not used to your
Zora body?

Perhaps it would be quicker to
give up.

If you are once again ready to
depart, then climb onto my back.

Ready, Link?

What's wrong?
Returning to shore?

Hyeh, hyeh.

It is not shameful to retreat. That
in and of itself is a strategy.

All right. Climb onto my back.

Now I can continue resting in
peace. I too must abide the laws
of ancient times and again merely
watch from my deep slumber.
But the evil that haunts this land
has not completely vanished,
Link. I shall depart after
enjoying Lulu's voice a bit longer.
I think the gods can permit that.
Hyeh, hyeh, hyeh.

Pleased to meet you. I'm Lulu.

Please come to our concert in
town.

I guess being able to sing is a
wonderful thing, after all...

Mikau!
You came back safely!

That's good...

I was surprised when my voice
turned that lonely island into a 
turtle... 

But that song you played for
me...My mother used to sing it
often...long ago...

Those eggs were laid to remind me
of that.

That song was from when I was a
very young child, so I had
forgotten it...

I've put you through some horrible
experiences, Mikau.

But I'm all better now!

Well, the town's concert is very
soon.

Let's start our rehearsal!

One... two... three...

...Are you going to the temple
again?

If there is something left to do,
then quickly climb onto my back.

P--p-please...
My soul...
Heal it...

You have strange powers,
Link. I have a request for
you. Please follow me.

Here in the depths of Pinnacle
Rock live many dangerous sea
snakes...

My friend is trapped here.

Link, can you please find a
way to rid the area of all the sea
snakes and help my friend?

Please do this for me. Please
defeat all the vicious sea snakes
and save my friend.

Please follow me closely without
making any missteps.

If you try to go beyond Pinnacle
Rock, you'll get lost in the murky
water.

Before you know it, you'll find
yourself back where you started,
so be careful.

Thank you, Link.
This is a symbol of my deepest
gratitude.

Help me...
Please, take me back to the
waters near Pinnacle Rock...

Are you interested in that fish?

It's a rare fish, isn't it?
It's called a sea horse.

I caught it swimming around here.
Just off of Pinnacle Rock.

Since it's rare, I was thinking of
selling it at the town carnival,
which should be starting soon.

If you want, I'll give it to you.

On one condition...

Do you have a pictograph of the
female pirates?

If you want that sea horse, bring
me a pictograph of a female
pirate.

Oh! That's my hookshot that the
pirates stole!

...If you have it, then that means
you've been to the Pirates'
Fortress.

In that case, you've got one, don't
you? Don't hide it!

What's this? I guess you don't
have one after all.

Technically, I do have a pictograph
of a female pirate, but it's all
blurry and it's not that great...

The all-important face...I can't see
it very well!

Oh! That's it! That's it!
I had a picture like that.

Well, aren't you a crafty one?

You'll give that to me, won't you?

In exchange, I'll give you this!

Thank you.
Hurry! Take me back to the
waters near Pinnacle Rock...

With pictographs, the sepia tone
conveys a lot more emotion than
color. Isn't it great?

This picture you gave me is gonna
be one of my treasures.

Well, if it isn't a Zora?
How have things been going
lately?

Har-harrr!
...Could you be coming to see me
'cause you can't catch any fish?

It's not good out there...
Lately, I've been coming back
empty-handed myself.

Why, I was almost hoping you
were coming to share with me!

Sorry, but I don't have any fish to
share with you.

I've been catching fish in these
seas for 30 years.

When it comes to catching fish,
I'm even better than the Zoras.

...That's what I'd like to be saying,
anyway.

Lately, the seawater has gotten
really warm.

It hasn't helped my fishing at all...

And what's worse, this water has
gotten murky, so when I ship out,
I always lose my way and
somehow end up back at shore.

We fishermen--and even the
fish--are in a real predicament!

If the seas don't return to normal
soon...

The Zoras...and even I...will be
all dried up!

Heh-heh! Isn't she pretty?

But, you know...

Those female pirates are so
frightening, they could scare a
crying baby into silence...

See, it was long ago when I used
to use this thing called a
hookshot to catch fish off the
coast...

But I was attacked by these
pirates, and they took it away
with them.

They say...
it's a legendary treasure..

And I just happened to swipe it
from the bottom of the sea, so I
hold no grudge against 'em.

It may be a treasure resting
somewhere in the Pirates' Fortress
at the edge of this coast.

The security at the Pirates'
Fortress is tight. Sneaking in is
no easy task.

If you're set on meeting those
beautiful pirates, try going to the
valley on the other side of town!

I've heard there's a mask there
that lets the wearer escape
detection.

Come to think of it, there was a
Zora floating lifelessly out in the
bay...

But there's probably no helping him
now...

Oh, sorry! Evenings and the first
thing in the morning are my break
times. Come back later.

Now that the seas are back to
normal, I've started a little
business aimed at tourists.

If you pay 20 Rupees, I'll invite
you to a jumping game that has a
really big prize!

If you're up for it, go to that
island in the center.

Oh, you're up for it!

Now then, I'll explain the rules, so
listen carefully.

I'm going to light the torches on
each of the surrounding four
islands in a particular order.

Jump to the island that has the
lit torch. If you can jump to it
before the torch goes out, you'll
get one point!

If you get 20 or more points
within the time limit, you'll get a
big prize! But it'll cost you
20 Rupees for one try.

How about it? Will you give it a
try?
Sure
No thanks

Aw, that's too bad!
And it's so fun, too.
You're missing out...

Hmmm...
You don't have enough Rupees.
Maybe next time.

Great!
In that case, I'll start.

Oh, that's out of bounds. That's
against the rules!

Huh? Didn't I tell you?

Oh, yeah...
If you fall, then that's that.
You'll have to try again.

All right...That's it!

What do you think?
It's harder than it seems, isn't it?

Some things in this world just
look easy until you try them. But I
know you'll try again!

Uh-oh!
That was a little too easy...
Oh well, here's your prize!

And I was thinking of saving up
to buy a big ship...

Now it looks like I may go
bankrupt!

Thank you for saving me.

I know it may be asking too much,
but I have a request for you,
brave one.

Please bring back my friend who
was caught by the fisherman.

I beg you. You're the only one I
can rely on.

Any good picture of a pirate will
do--even a snapshot of a guard.
Can't you help me out?

Oh, and if you're going to the
Pirates' Fortress, don't forget to
take your pictograph box.

...Ah, well, it's not that you have
to take it...
Heh, heh, heh...

Oh, too bad.
You don't have an empty bottle to
keep the sea horse in!

Umm...
Well, this certainly is a pirate...

But I can't be pleased with a shot
that looks like this.

Bring me one that's a better shot
of a pirate.

You again?
You can't fool me with your
green clothes!

You want an empty bottle, don't
you? You never learn your lesson!

Koo, koo, koo.
OK, I'll give you one. 

But...

Only if you can swim through all
the rings in the river in under
two minutes.

So, do you wanna try?
 
Sure
No thanks

The way out is over there!

Koo, koo, koo.
If you want an empty bottle, I can
give you one...

But only if you can swim through
all the rings in the river in under
two minutes.

There's a total of 20 rings. You
must swim through them in the
right order for it to count. Swim
through the ring that's flashing.
I'll show you the way, so follow
me and don't get separated!

OK...Time's up!

Want to try again?
 
Sure
No thanks

The way out is over there!

You cheated, didn't you?
You didn't get all the rings!

Wanna try again?
 
Sure
No thanks

The way out is over there!

Uh...That was perfect.

That's not good...

Did you call me, little brother?

I called you, big brother!
Actually...

What?
An empty bottle?

Yeah...
An empty bottle.

......

Don't worry, little brother!

To us, empty bottles are a
treasure.

I can't give you one just because
you beat my little brother.

We can't just give you one.

I'll give you one after you race
once more against me.

So, will you try?
 
Sure
No thanks

He says he won't do it, little
brother!

He's no fun. He's just a stick
in the mud.

The rules are the same, but this
time there are 25 rings.

Don't fall behind!

You cheated, didn't you?
You didn't get all the rings!

You didn't clear them all!

Want to try once more?
 
Sure
No thanks

Koo, koo, koo.
He says he won't do it, little
brother!

Koo, koo, koo.
That's right, big brother!

He did it, little brother.

Yeah, he did it, big brother.

There's nothing we can do, little
brother.

......
This is a mess, big brother.

We underestimated you.

He's back, little brother.

Yeah, he's back, big brother.

But we don't have any more empty
bottles...do we, little brother?

No, we don't have any, big
brother.

If you say you still want to race,
though, that's fine.

What will you do?
 
I'll Race
I won't race

The way out is over there!

First, you have to start with my
little brother. This time, the limit
is 1:50.

Don't fall behind!

He did it again, little brother.

He did it again, big brother.

...That's shameful, little brother.

Now race me!

What will you do?
 
I'll race
I won't race

I guess he's just a stick in
the mud, little brother.

Surprising, isn't it, big
brother?

The time limit is the same as it
was for my little brother--1:50.
...But there are 25 rings this time.

Don't fall behind!

He's a formidable opponent, little
brother!

You're all just talk, eh, big
brother?

If we give THAT to him, I wonder
if he'll leave us alone, little
brother.

Yeah, I want to quit, big brother.

Please! Let it be over.

First, you must race my little
brother. This time around, you
have to beat 1:40.

Don't fall behind!

The time limit is the same as it
was for my little brother--1:40.
But now there are 25 rings.

Don't fall behind!

Please! Let it be over.

Huh? The moon?

It's gotten bigger again.
Th-this is bad...

I thought I heard some loud noises
inside, and I came in to check it
out...

This place...
Is this some sort of underground
shelter?

Did you find this place?

I beg you! Let me have this
place! Not for free, of course.
I hope this will do...

I'm just glad it was something you
needed...

Anyhow, I won't be needing it
much longer anyway... 

That's my life's fortune. If you'll
let me have this place for that
much, it'll be worth it.

Anyhow, the need for Rupees will
soon be gone...

I thought I heard loud noises
coming from here, and when I
came to take a look...

I had no idea this place was
here...I'll be safe here for sure.
I'm glad I found it early.

I had no idea there was a
basement here...

If only you could have done
something about this place
yesterday...

I could have given you a wallet
that holds more Rupees...

That's my life savings. If I can
buy safety with it, then it's
worth it.

That's my life savings. If I can
buy safety with it, then it's worth
it.

I had no idea this place was
here...Perhaps, it just might keep
me safe. I'm just glad I found it.

I heard loud noises coming from
inside and was worried, but when I
came to check it out...

I never thought I'd find a place
like this...

But dang, if only you could have
done something two days ago...

I could have given you a wallet
that holds more Rupees...

Well, that's all I have on me...
I hope it's enough.

Well, that's all I have on me.
I hope it's enough...

There's no time left.
Hurry! We have to hide...

Only a little more than two days
left...Oh, Goddess of Time, please
save me...

Only a little more than one day
left...Oh, Goddess of Time, please
save me...

Only a little time left...Oh,
Goddess of Time, please save me...

Huh?

Ah! Captain, sir! It's been a long
time since we've seen you!

As you have ordered, sir, we are
investigating the secrets of this
place.

According to the information I
have obtained, it seems �
should be shot first!

According to the information I

According to the information I

Have I fulfilled my duties, sir?
Yes
No

Ahh! Thank you, sir!
I hope the information I have
provided will be of assistance to
you, sir.
Now, as you ordered, sir, I will
finish the last of my duties.

Yessir!

I-Is that so, sir?
Uh...I apologize, sir!

I shall continue my investigation!

Hey, you!
Halt!!!

I've been waiting for you!

And, did you find the rest of the
eggs?

...N-No.
B-But...that's beca...

What are you trying to pull
here?!?

If people hear the great pirates
have lost the treasure they stole,
we'll become the laughing stock!

Yes, b-but Aveil...

The sea is strangely murky where
we were attacked by the sea
snakes...

Silence!

That's why the Zoras can't send
for any help!

Now that the eggs are gone, the
Zoras should be frantically
searching for them.

If we don't hurry, the Zoras will
get to them before we do!

There are four eggs here now.

Hurry! Go find the other three
eggs before those sea snakes eat
them!

...Understood...

Wait!!!

The Zora eggs are the only clue
we have about that dragon cloud
floating over the bay...

If what that strange, masked one
says is true...

And if we can get our hands on
the treasure that lies sleeping in
the temple in that dragon cloud...

Then we can spend the rest of
our lives living the good life!

So get a move on and go find
them! Now!!!

Understood!!!

Halt!

It takes courage to come thieving
in the Pirates' Fortress!

I'm going to love doing this to
you!

Ugh.
Don't think it ends here!

Hmph! You're nothing to talk
about...Come back and try me
again!

That's as far as you go!

How unfortunate. You won't be
getting past here!

Ugh! Not bad...
But don't think it ends here!

Hmph!
We're not to be made fools of!

We aren't fooled by that mask!

Do you think you can trick us
with that mask?

Halt!
Everyone!!!
A rat has snuck in!

Halt!
Everyone! A rat wearing a
strange mask has snuck in!

What's with you?

This room belongs to Japas, the
genius bassist of the Zora Band.

Go through my manager if you
want my autograph.

The concert's coming soon. Let's
forget about our bandmates and
their messed-up problems and
have a jam session of our own.

Mikau!!!

Where've ya been?

I'm all, like, "Hey, where's Mikau?
The concert's comin' up soon!"

And now our band leader has
pulled a vanishing act--Evan's all
holed up in his room just writin'
songs...

And to top it off, Lulu just
stands out back starin' at the
sea. She doesn't even respond
when ya talk to her.

If you guys think it's just 'cause
Lulu's not interested in me, I'd
understand, but I'm tellin' ya, it
looks like somethin's really wrong.

Is there somethin' you're trying to
hide from me?

I'm not runnin' an inquiry or
anything...

But, look...If we don't start
rehearsin' real soon, we're not
gonna be ready for the concert.

What were the other band
members doing?

You do know that if we don't
start rehearsing, we're not gonna
be ready for the concert, right?

Hey...Why don't we forget about
waiting for Evan to write a song
and just write one ourselves?

If you feel up to it, let's have a
little jam session.

Did you play our song for Evan?
What did he say?

Don't tell me...

You didn't forget the song, did
you?
Yeah, I did
No, I didn't

Well, in that case, hurry up and
play Evan our song.

Oh, man. In that case, I guess we
have to have another jam session.
Are ya ready?

Huh?
You wanna have a jam session?

Try following this phrase I wrote
on your guitar.

Here we go...

Whoooa...
That's niiiice.

I got it! I got it! I got it!
Here I go!

That's got a good feel to it! Even
Evan should like this.

But...

He's so proud...He'd resent the
fact that we wrote somethin' on
our own. I don't think he'd even
let the others try it out.

Whaddya think we should do?

How can we, like, make sure that
Evan doesn't find out that it was
us who wrote this song?

Can't you think of anything?

That melody's bogus, man!

What's wrong? You're not jammin'
like you usually do!

You wanna stop?
 
Yeah
No

You in a slump?
Don't worry about it...

Those were the kind of notes an
amateur would play while tryin' to
figure out the notes as he goes...

Once you're back in the groove,
we'll write a song that'll knock
Evan off his flippers!

When you're in a slump, all ya
can do is go back to your room
and sleep on it.

That's uncool, man...
What are you tryin' to do, walkin'
into people's rooms like that?

Do you wanna have a jam session
with me usin' that instrument?

Sorry, but try somethin' else.

Mikau?
Where've you been? Where've you
been? I was worried.

The concert in town is coming up,
but it seems like all the band
members are in a funk. I betcha
didn't know that, huh?

Especially Lulu.
I haven't heard her voice in a long
time.

She's usually in good spirits, too.

Ooh! Ooh! I wonder if this is
related to the ocean turning all
weird...

Actually...
I know a little bit of Lulu's
secret.

Do you wanna hear it?
 
I wanna hear it
Not really

There's a rumor that the ocean is
getting weird 'cause there's
trouble off shore at Great Bay
Temple.

And they say when that happens,
something bad will befall the Zora
descendant who's been protecting
the temple.

Do you catch my drift?

And lately, Lulu has been looking
kind of weird. Maybe Lulu's the...

Oh, yeah, that's right. There aren't
any secrets between you and Lulu.

Ooh! Ooh!
Don't tell Lulu that I've been
saying stuff about her...

Um...
Don't get mad, but I want you to
hear this...

I tried to climb up the other
ladder to your practice area, and
it broke. I'm gonna go on a diet
now, so just forgive me, OK?

Ooh! Ooh!
How's Lulu?
Is she talking to you?

Look...
It's about Lulu's secret...

Huh? Who are you?
You can't just come walkin' in
here.

I don't have a problem, but I think
my roommate might get mad.

Just follow the rules if you're one
of our fans.

This is a problem. You just can't
come in and hang out in our
room!

Can you read Zoran script?

Mikau
My Diary

Today, Japas and I had a jam
session. He's not good with words,
but he writes great riffs.

Here's what I played:

Today, I had Lulu listen to my
session with Japas.

She seemed to like it a lot.
Lulu's a pretty great girl,
after all.

Today, I had another jam session
with Japas.

Evan was in a bad mood 'cause
the two of us are writin' songs on
our own.

Here's what I played:

Evan called me over this morning.
It was something about Lulu.

He was in a real rush. I wonder
what it could be?

By the way, it seems my lucky
color this week is green.

Mikau! How was it? Did you get
the eggs back?

You did it, Mikau!

OK...Take that egg straight to the
professor at the Marine Research
Lab.

I've already talked to the
professor. Leave the rest up to
him.

Oh, thank goodness! Lulu's voice
has been brought back to normal!

I've already talked to the
professor, so after delivering the
eggs, you can leave the rest up
to him.

How was it? Did the professor at
the Marine Research Lab figure
out the mystery of the eggs?

Oh...
You couldn't do it, after all.

Have you been to see Lulu out in
back by the ocean?

Ever since the pirates stole her
eggs, she's just been standing out
there gazing at the sea and
sighing...

...Mikau!
We need those eggs safe so Lulu
can get her voice back.

We've grown accustomed to life
in a peaceful sea...

The only one among the Zora tribe
who is still able to go to blows
with those wild pirates...

It is you, with the blood of Zoran
heroes flowing within you.

I'm still keeping Lulu's problem a
secret from the other band
members.

They've all been looking forward to
our Carnival of Time concert.

And I can't tell them it's canceled
'cause Lulu can't sing, can I?

Anyway, Mikau, did you get an
empty bottle that you can use to
carry the eggs in?

One bottle can only hold one egg,
so you can never have too many
empty bottles.

I told you that the beavers above
the waterfall on the Zora Hall
coast have empty bottles, right?

If you don't have any yet, Mikau,
you should go there before
heading off to the Pirates'
Fortress.

The Carnival of Time concert is
quickly approaching...

Hurry up and get those eggs back
from the pirates.

I already told you the beavers
above the waterfall have empty
bottles, right?

If you don't have any yet, you
should go there before going to
the Pirates' Fortress.

What is this?
You can't just come into people's
rooms and make yourself at home!

Ahh...
If Lulu's voice doesn't return,
I don't know what we can do...

Hey!
How did you get in here?

I shouldn't have to put up with
this...People not associated with
the band aren't allowed in here.

If you want an autograph, we'll be
giving them out at the town's
carnival, so wait until then.

Were you guys secretly writing a
song behind my back again?

Isn't songwriting the job of the
bandleader? What, you're not
happy with my songs?

I heard that song. If you write
any other good songs, I'd like
to hear them.

Huh?
That song?

Hmmm...
It works, it works,
it works!

Not bad...
That's a pretty good song I just
made up!

You've got a good sense of
melody! We'll play my new song at
our next show! Take this in
thanks!

You're not thinking I'm stealing
your song, do you? 

If you want an autograph, I'll give
you one after our rehearsal.

What have you been doing? You're
late, Mikau!

Ooh! Ooh!
Guess what! Lulu's voice...
She's gotten it back!

Hurry up and go see Lulu.

And with that, we're all ready.
I can't wait for the town's
concert.

We've kept you waiting! Just a
little bit longer and we'll play our
hot sound for you!

You're late, Mikau! Where were
you while you were skippin'
practice?

Lulu's been waiting for you.

What were you doing?
Hurry up and go talk to Lulu!

Hey, Mikau...

That song Evan wrote sounds just
like the one we played at our jam
session, doesn't it?

I've written a great song, so just
be patient.

You did great, Mikau.
Lulu's voice has returned.

Well, it looks like Lulu wants to
talk to you, so go see her
now.

Well, hurry up!
We're about to start rehearsal.

I'm glad I got this new song done
in time for the concert.

You did great, Mikau. And even
without any practice.

You really are a musical genius...

You're an unusual sight to see in
this neck of the water...

You came to see the Zora band,
The Indigo-Go's, didn't you?

The members of The Indigo-Go's
are in Zora Hall up ahead...

But the entrance is underwater,
so if you aren't a good diver, you
probably won't make it in.

The members of The Indigo-Go's
are up ahead in Zora Hall...

But if you can't dive deep
underwater, you won't get in.

Hey, aren't you Mikau?
Were you able to get an empty
bottle from the beavers on top of
the waterfall?

Those guys are quick, so it's
pretty tough, isn't it?

But what do you need an empty
bottle for, Mikau?

Can you break all those jars
behind me in one try?

Among us Zora, there are some
who can.

If you do it, I'll give you
something good.

Anything's worth a try!
Think it over and give it a shot.

Hey, Mikau...
You wanna do that thing you used
to always do?

You just can't play guitar all the
time. You gotta get out and move
your body once in a while.

Clock Town's carnival is coming
soon and business there is good.
That'd be nice...Things here aren't
picking up yet.

We haven't been able to catch any
fish in the ocean, so we have to
go to town to buy them.

We never had a need for Rupees
until now.

I have a shop inside Zora Hall, so
actually I'd like you to go there
and buy a lot of stuff...

I don't want to sound greedy, but
I need to make money for the
jars.

We can't fish in the ocean
anymore, so everyone's going into
town to buy them instead.

But I just can't get used to the
taste of fish from a river.

But a Zora's gotta eat, so there's
no way around it.

If your band does well with its
concert in town, it'll bring tourists
here and...

I won't have to ask for jar money.

Way to go, Mikau!

You've got a big smirk on your
face...

Well, here's 100 Rupees.

Except...
Jar replacement costs 10 Rupees,
so I'll have to deduct that.

You get 90 Rupees!

Take the challenge again sometime.

Whoa!
There are others besides Zoras
who can do it...

What's wrong? Have you lost your
touch from playing too much
guitar, Mikau?

Didn't you used to be able to
break all these pots at once?

Your motion was all stiff like
someone who's not used to doing
this...

Sorry, but I have to take
10 Rupees for those broken jars.

Hey, that's a problem...Don't go
breaking my jars. Those jars
aren't free, you know.

What? You don't even have
10 Rupees?

I guess there's nothing I can do...
I'll just have to eat the loss.

If you break them all at once, I'll
give you something good.

Take the challenge again sometime.

This is the room of Mikau and
Tijo, the guitarist and drummer for
the Zora band, The Indigo-Go's.

They don't meet with ordinary
people.

No way. If you want to meet
Mikau and Tijo, you'll have to go
through their manager.

Hey, Mikau...
I haven't seen you in a while.
Where have you been?

Oh, that's right. Evan, your
bandleader, is looking for you.

Evan came by several times
looking for you. Have you seen
him yet?

This is the room of Japas, bassist
for the Zora band, The Indigo-Go's.

I'm sorry, but he's busy practicing
for the concert, so I can't let you
see him.

If you're not a band member, you
can't go in...Even if you're an
acquaintance.

Mikau...
Do you need to see Japas?

You're gonna have another jam
session with him, aren't you?
I can't wait!

I'm expecting a cool performance
in your jam session with Japas.

This is the room of Evan, the
leader of the Zora Band, The
Indigo-Go's.

He's a nervous guy, so nobody's
allowed inside unless they're on
official business.

Unless you have official business,
it's impossible to see him until
after the concert.

Ah! Mikau!
What have you been doing this
whole time?

Evan the bandleader has been
waiting for you for a while now.
Hurry! Go in! Go in!

Stop worrying the bandleader like
you do...

Shut up! I'm busy.
Don't talk to me!

Shut up. I'm busy right now...

Ah! Mikau!
You caught me!

Eee...I...uh...er, L-Lulu's been
l-looking kinda weird lately...
I was w-worried...

It's not like I was s-spying on
her or anything...

I-I'm not some k-kind of weirdo or
some sorta slimy fish or anything.
...Um, yeah.

Uh...I just r-remembered that I
have somewhere to be...What time
is it? Um, yeah. I hafta be there,
like, now. Uhhh...See ya!

Did you come to see The
Indigo-Go's rehearse, too?

No?

Have you heard of The
Indigo-Go's?
Of course
No

I thought so. The Indigo-Go's are
pretty big now, aren't they?

Their rehearsal is about to begin,
so I thought you came to see
them.

But even though their concert in
town is tomorrow, they still
haven't started rehearsing.

I wonder what they're doing?

Huh? You don't know them?
The Indigo-Go's is that popular
band that's going to be doing a
concert in town soon!

They've got Evan, the keyboard
king, the thumping bass of Japas,
the cool drum beat of Tijo...

But above all, Mikau's weeping
guitar and the shimmering voice of
Lulu make the best songs!

Ah, you're Mikau, right? Good luck
practicing for the concert!

I'm looking forward to your 
rehearsal.

Aren't you going to rehearse?

Or are you just gonna hit the
stage without any practice?

Hohhh!
That's a real genius guitarist!
So bold!

The stage lights turned on! The
rehearsal's gotta start soon.

Ahh...Lulu!
Hurry up and show your face on
stage!

Did you come here to see The
Indigo-Go's 'cause you couldn't
wait for the concert?

I heard they were having a
rehearsal, and I've been waiting
here ever since.

But the stage lights aren't even
lit, so it looks like it'll be a while
before rehearsals start.

I wonder when they're gonna
start? C'mon, I want to see my
Lulu.

Ah! Mikau!
Hey, what's Lulu doing now?

I'm so jealous of you! To always
be able to breathe the same air
as Lulu...

And you know a side of Lulu that
I don't...You know her private side,
don't you?

That's wonderful. I won't ask you
to introduce me. A pictograph will
do. Show me Lulu's private side.

Did you by chance bring something
of Lulu's?

If it's about Lulu, I want to know
everything. I'll take anything...You
know? I'm the consummate fan!

Hmmm...This isn't that great, but
I'll buy it off you anyway.

Next time, bring me a better shot
that really captures Lulu.
If you do that...
I'll do you no wrong.

Oh! Lulu's face.
It's irresistible!

Please let me have this!
OK? OK?

Keep the change.

For this kind of pictograph, I'll
take as many as you have, so
bring more!

Hey, you can't do that. No
climbing up on the rehearsal
stage.

We're doin' the sound check right
now, so don't make any noise.

Hurry up and get off the stage.

Mikau, you're just in time. I want
to check the levels on your
guitar.

Can you play me a note?

Mikau, can you play me a quick
note?

Ack!
That's a little too loud.

I guess I'll turn it down a bit...

OK. Thanks, Mikau.

Huh?
That's a little too quiet...

I guess I'll turn it up a bit...

OK. Thanks, Mikau.

Wha? They're off again. That's a
problem...

Are you free? If you have a sec,
could you go light the second
floor's seating lights?

Unless those are on, the stage
lights won't come on.
Thanks.

Are you the one who turned those
lights on?

You saved me.
Here...Go buy whatever you like!

All right...The lights are all good.
Now we just have to wait...
But they'll probably go out 
again pretty soon...

What do you want, Mikau?
Are you checking the stage?

I don't know why, but there's
something wrong with the
lighting...

The lighting isn't working right.

Mikau...
How do you like it? The lights are
perfect.

Now hurry up and do start your
rehearsal before the lights go out.
Hurry! Hurry!

Hurry and start your rehearsal
before the lights go out.

Huh? Here too? This is a problem.
Rehearsal hasn't started yet, so I
guess it's OK, but...

Once rehearsal starts, you'll have
to buy a ticket!

The Indigo-Go's is a wildly popular
band right now.

If we don't sell tickets to their
rehearsals, too, we'll end up with
tons of people showing up.

Once the rehearsal starts, you'll
have to buy a ticket. You just
can't go and take a seat.

Oy! Mikau! What's up with the
rehearsal?

I've been told that rehearsal is
about to begin...

But the band members are still
shut away in their rooms...

And Lulu's just hanging around by
that lone island out back.
What's going on?

Is Lulu all right? She was just
staring out at the lone island in
back...She looks kinda strange.

Welcome.
What are you looking for?

We didn't have what you wanted?

Welcome.
Did you come to buy something,
little guy?

Didn't the big guy's shop have
what you were looking for?

Welcome.

Did you find something?

Ah! Mikau.
Welcome!

You don't quite seem like yourself
today, Mikau.

Quit shopping

You came to see The Indigo-Go's,
too, didn't you?
I can tell.

The celebrities' dressing rooms are
near here. Maybe you can take a
peek...
Just don't get caught.

Lately, I've had a hard time even
getting fish in stock, so this is
all I have.

Your band's popularity is amazing.
We've had all kinds of people
coming into the shop lately.

Hero's Shield: 90 Rupees
This is the shield that heroes
use, but it doesn't sell very well
here.

Hero's Shield: 90 Rupees
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

10 Arrows: 20 Rupees
These fly well when shot from a
bow, and you need one if you
want to buy any of these.

10 Arrows: 20 Rupees
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

Red Potion: 60 Rupees
Drink this when your energy is
low to ease your weariness.

Red Potion: 60 Rupees
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

You can't hold anymore.

You don't have an empty bottle to
put it in...

You don't have enough Rupees.

Thanks again.

Take care.

Mikau, haven't you seen any
gold-colored fish around here?

Gold-colored fish know this area
very well.

I was thinking of getting one to
guide me to Pinnacle Rock...

If the water wasn't so murky,
I wouldn't have to rely on the
guidance from a gold-colored fish.

I heard that the pirates were
attacked by sea snakes near the
creatures' lair.

It seems they dropped something
precious there. Don't you wonder
what it was, Mikau?

But we'd have to get through that
murky water to look for it...

Where are all the gold-colored
fish when we need them?

Yo, Mikau!
The seawater has gradually
returned to normal.

But that weird, murky water hasn't
dissipated completely...

Before long, the fish will come
back, too!

Are you taking a relaxing sea
bath? Isn't the water here too
warm for it to feel good?

Plus, with all this murky water
around, you'd better be careful!

Can't you go for a nice swim now
that the water temperature has
gone down?

How is it?

Ah! Mikau!
What are you doing in a place like
this?

This is the ominous Pirates'
Fortress. I don't think you should
get too close.

Uh...But I'm OK...

Well, actually...

The pirates in this fortress are
all women. And better yet, I hear
they're all gorgeous.

Heh, heh...So, I thought maybe
I should check 'em out.

What??
Don't look at me like that...

The Pirates' Fortress usually is
closed off by an iron gate, so you
can't get in from here.

And even if you did get in, it's
not like the pirates would welcome
you.

Yo, Mikau!
Did you do something to the
pirates?

The pirates were just looking for
a Zora dressed in green clothing.

Isn't that you?

It sounded like the pirates had
some unfinished business to settle
with you...

Did you do something?

Is this your first time at the
ocean? This is the ominous
Pirates' Fortress.

If you hang around too long, the
pirates will see you and get you.

If you came here to go swimming,
you should go somewhere else.

Mikau! What are you doing?
Everyone's already up on stage.

The Indigo-Go's will start
rehearsing soon.

Mikau! Man, you're guitar playing
is the best!

How'd you like The Indigo-Go's?
Aren't they the best?

How do you feel, Mikau? We can't
wait to hear you!

I'm so excited...

Yeah! Mikau, isn't Lulu's singing
the greatest?

Hey! Did you hear that? This
guarantees the concert in town
is gonna be a huge success.

Late, Mikau?
Hurry up and get on stage.

Shhh!
Their rehearsal is about to start.

Mikau!
That new song has a nice feel to
it. I really like it.

What d'ya think?
Doesn't the new song by The
Indigo-Go's sound great?

Mikau!!!
Hurry...Make your guitar gently
weep for me!

Don't watch the rehearsal from
here.

Ohh!
You rock! Your guitar playing
really is the best!

Well, aren't they amazing? The
concert in town...That's gonna be
even better.

Mikau! I can't wait to hear the
new song!

Oh, you are so lucky! I just
heard that they're gonna play a
new song in rehearsal.

That's a great song!
But the feel was a little different
from Evan's usual songs.

Did you hear the new song?
I think it's gonna go over well in
town, too.

Hey! Hey, Mikau!
Don't hang around here.
Hurry up and start the rehearsal!

I think The Indigo-Go's will start
rehearsing soon. What's that
Mikau been doing?

That's uncool, Mikau. Don't be late
to rehearsals. But it was a good
performance.

How'd you like it?
Can't wait for the concert, can
you?

You finally came, Mikau. The other
members are standing by!

The moon's been kinda spooky
around here lately. Have you
noticed it? I wonder if I'm the
only one who thinks so.

That had a good feel to it. Now,
if the concert goes like that...

But of course it'll go that well.
Sorry. Don't mind me.

That was a perfect performance
by The Indigo-Go's, wasn't it? But
I have a bad feeling about
something...

Leeeeave it!
Leeeeave it!

If you don't have it, I have no
need for you! Awayyy!

Ah! Thisss! Thissss! I bear
you no remorssse!

...Not enough.
Leeeeave more!

Leeeave me something blue that
bestows health!

Leeeave me something delicious to
chomp on. Something that sprouts
when it's watered.
Preferably five of them...

Leeeave me H...2...O.

Leeeaave me something deliciously
fresh!

Leeeaave me something small and
creepy!

Leeeaave me something that
makes a blinding flash!
Preferably ten of them.

Leeeaave me ten refreshing
blasts!

Leeeaave me something warm that
can melt ice and quench one's
spirits.

Leeave me a ghost...A big one at
that!

Leeeaave me something rich in
calcium!

Master! You called!

...!!!

What are you???

R-regrettable...
Although my rival, you were
spectacular.

I shall take my bow by opening my
heart and revealing my wisdom...

Belief or disbelief rests with you.

To die without leaving a corpse...
That is the way of us Garo.

To cross the valley of Ikana, aim
at the river beasts with the
arrowhead that freezes.

The soul of the composer named
Flat rests in Ikana Graveyard.
I have heard his brother, Sharp is
here in Ikana.

That which was acquired in Ikana
Castle shall open the way to
Stone Tower. That is all I know.

Atop the hill here in Ikana, no
human presence is felt, except
that of the parent and child living
in the house with the waterwheel.

Every two minutes on every day,
the girl who lives in the music
box house goes to the dried well
to check on something.
But as long as the spirits are
wandering outside her house, she
dares not leave her home.

To revive the dried-up river on
Ikana hill, you must go to the
spring water cave.

If one tries to enter the spring
water cave without knowing the
song buried in a grave, that poor
visitor shall meet with disaster.

To save the cursed human, his
soul must be healed.

The well atop the hill and the well
at Ikana Castle's inner garden are
one.

As the Gibdos in Ikana's well have
regrets and long to savor items
from this world, they continue to
wander about.

Most of that which the Gibdos
regret can be found inside the
well itself.

The ReDeads in Ikana were once
members of the castle's dancing
troupe...

A hole can be opened in the
ceiling of a particular room in
Ikana Castle.

But it cannot be broken without
an explosive with incredible might.

In entering Ikana Castle, there is
another secret route apart from
the well entrance.

To counter the rage of the King
of Ikana Castle, burn away that
which disrupts the light and shine
the sacred rays on the King.

To think I could be defeated...
Although my rival, you were
spectacular.

I shall take my bow by opening my
heart and revealing my wisdom...

If you shoot that which releases
the sacred golden light into the
blood-stained, red emblem outside
the temple...
it shall rearrange things, in which
the earth is born in the heavens
and the moon is born on the
earth.

Do not forget these words...
Die I shall, leaving no corpse.

That is the law of us Garo.

Brrrinnnggg them!

Those inssside...Our friendsss...
Brrrriiiiinnnng them!

Huh?

Aah! Captain, sir!!!
Excuse me, sir!

Everyone, give the captain your
attention!

We haven't seen you in some time,
captain, sir!

As per your orders, sir, we've
been guarding these graves
closely.

We have all been expecting your
next order, sir.

What shall we do?
 
Guard the grave
Open the grave

Yes, sir! We'll continue with this
strategy, sir!

Yes, sir!

O-open it?

Everyone!
Follow me!

Captain!
What is your next command?

Huh?

Oh, Captain!
E-excuse me, sir!

The squad leader is in front of
that grave over there, sir.

The melody that summons the
tears of angels rests here.

A vessel that holds wandering
spirits rests here.

A piece that heals the wounded
soul rests here.

When one who possesses eyes
that can see the truth arrives,
the piece far below shall awaken.

Ye who awaken me, battle me.
Then shall I extinguish the furious
flame.

Aaaaieeee!!!
Th-they're out!

Why are they out when it's not
even night?

I am Dampe, the grave keeper,
who watches over this graveyard.

My face is frightening, but I am
not a bad person!

All the graves here belong to the
family members of the King of
Ikana Castle, a place that lies
beyond the mountains.
Even nowadays, the ghosts come
out at night. It is a frightening
graveyard.

Did you see the huge skeleton at
the back of this graveyard?

My father once said that was all
that was left of the former Royal
Soldier who once guarded this
graveyard.
Even though he is dead, his
remains still block the way. In a
sense, he is still guarding the
Royal Family's treasure.
He must have been a fine soldier,
indeed.

Do you want see the dancing
bones?

If you do, then just wait here
until night comes.

I don't want to see something evil
like that, though...

Don't bother me!

Soon, a whole lot of frightful
ghosts will appear.

You should go home, too...
Before you get attacked!

There are a lot of bats out today.
I don't like bats.

I wish they'd go away.

Aaaieeee!!!
Th-they're out!

Go away!

You? Wh-who are you? I can't see
'cause it's too bright...You're not a
ghost...are you?

...A fairy?

Oh, it was the fairy's light. In
that case, it's just perfect.

I came looking for the Royal
Family's legendary treasure, but
my torch has gone out.

I'm sorry, but could you walk 
in front of me and light the way?

Please?
Yes
No

I'm not going to give up. I'll keep
asking you until you say yes.

That's how I courted my current
wife, you know.

So...Will you lead me through the
dark?

You will?
In that case, I'll use your light as
I walk.

Just lead me to the place where
you think the treasure chest is
buried.

I'll even split the treasure with
you...I'm counting on you now.

Where were you?
You suddenly vanished, so I got
worried. Your light is all I have to
go on.

Hey! Where'd you go?
I wish you'd walk a little slower.

Oh!
There's something strange about
this spot.

You want me to dig here?
Yes
No

...In that case, take me to another
spot.

Nothing's turning up.
Take me to another spot.

Something strange is here, but
it isn't any treasure. Show me
another spot.

Waah!!!
It's the leader of the ghosts!

The soul of a brave soldier from
Ikana rests here.

Was it you who chased those bats
away?

That's a big help... 
It isn't much, but here's
30 Rupees for your trouble.
Take it!

I...I ain't seen nothing and I
d-don't know nothing...

Hey, that's a nice sword you
have...Heh, heh...

You know...Lately, frightening
ghosts have been appearing in
swarms in Ikana Village across the
river.
It seems they're the ghosts of
Ikana's Royal Family or something.

There's no one living there
anymore, so I moved nearby.
Heh, heh...

Now there's only a curious parent
and child living there while they
research the ghosts...Did I mention
that is one niiiiice sword?

Can I see it for a second?
Yes
No

Oh, fine!

Huh?!? Really?
I don't want to trouble you, but...

Wha? S-s-some red thing?!?
What is it? It s-s-seems hostile!

Wha? S-s-some red thing?!?
What is it? It seems h-hostile!

Yeah, the parent and child in
Ikana Village succeeded in driving
off the spirits with some giant
music box.

But I can't afford something that
ridiculously huge...

But that's just me...Heh, heh.

Of course, they need the river's
current to power the music box.

The river's all dried up, so there's
no value in stealing the music box
or ransacking the place...

Uh...Just rambling...Heh, heh.

......

I found him, green hat boy...

He's using this place as his safe
house for keeping his stolen
goods. Apparently, his name is
Sakon.
He came to the shop last night,
and I followed him.

His storage for the things he's
stolen is on the other side of this
rock door.
 
Only Sakon can open it. The only
way in is to wait for Sakon to
arrive.

I'll wait...I've made a promise to
Anju. He will show up.

Ah!

Look!
There's a mask there!!!

It's the Sun's Mask!

Now I've done it!

Step on that switch!!!

What??
Are you telling us what to do?!?

It's some setup where the door
stays open only while the switch
is pressed!

There should be some device in
this room that also opens the
door! Ohhh! The mask!

He's trying to pull it out of our
reach and make his escape...
We've got to hurry!

That's no good. This isn't the
switch...

Go check that room. There should
be some sort of mechanism.
Please! There's no time!!!

I don't like him...
But is there a choice?
Should we help him?

Not moving ahead in the face
of danger when you know it's for
the better is just like Tael.
...That's it...Let's go!

Yesss! My security system is
impenetrable

...We're locked in.

I'm sorry you got caught up in
all this. If you can get out, then
do it.

Anju is already fleeing to Cremia's
ranch.

You did great.
She'll...understand.
C'mon, let's go.
Play your ocarina and get us
outside. Let him be alone.

I got the Sun's Mask back!

There's still time!
I must get back to town!

Huh? Not yet?
I don't stand out at all?

...That's weird.
But I'm trying so hard...
Oh, well.

Huh?
Don't tell me...That's...

I'm shocked. You're the first
person who's ever spoken to me.

I've been here for many years,
waving my arms around and asking
for help, but everyone ignores me
and passes me by.
It's 'cause I'm about as impressive
as a stone, right?...I'm used to it,
though.

Umm...I have a request...Can you
give me some medicine that would
make even an unnoticable stone
like me feel better?

...After all, I'm a stone, so like a
stone, I won't move. I'll just wait
right here.

Ah, that...Is that it?

...I feel better, I think.

Thanks...
Oh...here...
In gratitude...

Now...Let me practice standing
out...

I am no longer part of the
living...My sadness to the moon...
I haven't left my dance to the
world...I am filled with regret.
(Translation)             
I am disappointed, oh moon.
I have died!

Oh, I planned to bring the world
together and stir it into a giant
melting pot with my dance!

If only I had taught my new dance
to someone...

Spread my dance across the world...
Train its followers...

(Translation)            
I have taught it to you, now make
it into a popular dance craze!

I am counting on you.

(Translation)            
I am counting on you.

Are you the one who freed my
soul?

I served the Ikana Royal family.
I am the composer called Flat.

The songs connected to the Royal
Family that remain here were all
composed by my brother and I.

Oh...Sharp,
my dear brother.

He sold his soul to the devil and
was the one who locked me in
here...

You who do not fear the dead,
learn well the song that is
inscribed behind me...

And if you ever meet my brother,
I'd like you to inform him...

The thousand years of raindrops
summoned by my song are my
tears.

The thunder that strikes the earth
is my anger!

...I have made my request.

The thousand years of raindrops
summoned by my song are my
tears.

The thunder that strikes the earth
is my anger!

Here is written the song that
shall cleanse his cursed, black
soul.

What business have you in Ikana
Kingdom, land where only the dead
roam?

This is no place for one as full of
life as you.

Or do you say that you wish to
join the dead?

That is fine...

If that is the case, then sleep
gently to the melody of darkness
that the great composer, Sharp,
shall play...
and join the ranks of the dead.

I understand your desire...

You don't give up. I see you really
do wish to join the ranks of the
dead.

Hmm?
Somehow, my heart is eased. This
melody has a serenity to it...
And yet...

To one of the dead and darkness,
like myself, a song like that no
longer holds meaning for me.

You shall end your futile
resistance and quickly join the
ranks of the dead.

W-What is this?
...This song?

...N-No, it can't be. 
This song...

Flat, my dear brother.

Forgive your foolish brother who
dreamt of the revival of the Royal
Family...

...Ye who do not fear the dead...

With my brother's song, you have
broken the curse that was placed
upon me. It is all thanks to you.

We dead should not be lingering
here in this land.

It was all a trick of the masked
one who had upset things.

If you truly do not fear the
dead...

I wish for you to go to the
temple in this land and sever the
root of the evil curse that
torments us.

To do that...

I, the only one who knows the
way into the temple, shall direct
you to the King.

The King is in the ruins of Ikana
Castle, awaiting the coming of the
one who will break the curse.

...I have made my final request.

Eee-hee-hee...
Ikana Kingdom was founded on
this land, stained with a history
of darkness, drenched in blood...
Even now it is a place where
troubled, regretful spirits gather.

If you are seeking the one who is
stronger than you are, you may
find strength here...

from a group of spirits plagued by
lingering regrets.

If you have faith in your skills
and might...

then try saving these wandering
spirits. 
Yee-hee-hee...

It is impossible in your current
state, but once you have eased
your weariness and have gained
faith in your skills...
You must try saving these
wandering spirits.
Yee-hee-hee...

But the earthly price you must
pay is 30 Rupees!

Will you still do it?
 
I'll do it
I won't do it

This is the kind of world we are
in, so this is the kind of business
that we must do. Yee-hee-hee!

Oh, but you haven't enough
Rupees. Well, that is too bad.

You are a boy of much vigor.

Defeat the ladies within the time
limit and rest their souls in peace.

But if your life energy drops
below three hearts, I will stop
the match.

Mercy is the least I can offer.

Are you prepared?
Yes
No

Gripped by fear?
Yee-hee-hee!

It seems their souls have been
healed.

I give to you the earthly
possession which the ladies kept.
Take it, Link.

That is your name, correct? I can
read people's hearts...

I knew you would be coming here...

Now, my own soul has been
healed, too. 
With that...
Yee-hee-hee!

Regardless of what mystical
powers you possess, you may not
fight any longer.

Whatever mystical powers you
possess will not help you...

If it takes you that long, you
cannot ease their souls...

Try again with that much energy?
Yes
No

Gripped by fear?
Yee-hee-hee.

You cannot heal all souls with
that song.

The earthly cost to you will be
30 Rupees!

I'd like to be able to take that
much...
But I shall take 10 Rupees...

Yee-hee-hee.
That's a nice mask you're wearing.

That is the mask of those who
roam this world with the most
lingering regrets!

Use it to ask them their regrets...

Perhaps you may be able to save
the souls that wander beyond
here.
Yee-hee-hee!

That is the mask of the leader of
the ninjas who once spied on the
hilltop castle with the
blood-stained history.

With that, you may be able to call
out their spirits that even now
are still wandering.

Perhaps you may be able to save
the souls that wander beyond
here...
Yee-hee-hee.

Yee-hee-hee.
You are wearing an interesting
mask.

That is the mask of the captain
of the soldiers who once served
to protect the castle on the
hilltop.

Now it is the gathering place
for the spirits of those with
lingering regrets.

Until now they wander, seeking
one who can save them.

You cannot save them with that
mask...Have you no other? It is
unfortunate, but I cannot let you
pass. Yee-hee-hee.

Yee-hee-hee.
Do you have your own horse?

And if you are not wearing the
mask that houses the wandering
spirits, which the black-hearted
one near the ranch has...
I will not let you pass.
Yee-hee-hee.

Yee-hee-hee.
What are you doing in a place like
this?

Ikana Hill beyond here is the place
where spirits with troubles and
lingering regrets wander.

Even now, the spirits wander
in search of one who can save
them.

It is unfortunate, but it is no
place for one such as you...

But if you must enter, then you
must obtain the mask containing
wandering spirits that can be
found near the ranch.

Without that mask, you cannot
save their souls...

Until then, I will not let you pass
by here.
Yee-hee-hee!

Yee-hee-hee!
Do you have your own horse?

And if you are not wearing the
mask containing wandering spirits
which the black-hearted one near 
the ranch has...
I will not let you pass.
Yee-hee-hee!

Yee-hee-hee.

It seems, somehow, you have
managed to send the Ikana's
wandering spirits into peace...

But outside of Ikana...
There are still swarms of
wandering spirits with lingering
regrets...

The ones in this room want to
meet you again and have been
waiting here for quite a while.

Go see them if you feel like it...

I'm sure they'll welcome you.
Yee-hee-hee!

Yee-hee-hee.
You really are an amazing person,
Link.

It seems you've somehow managed
to heal their souls...

Maybe I shall vanish soon myself.

Well, then...
Yee-hee-hee-hee!

Yee,-hee-hee!

If you want to meet the ones in
this room, then extend your life
energy more.

Oh, insolent one who has brought
the unthinkable into a land as
dark as Ikana...

My servants have fallen
namelessly before the light that
guides you.

However...

You shall see with your own
eyes...

You're blocking me!
Get out of the way!
I can still get him!

B-blocking you?!

The reason he beat us is because
you were so feeble! Don't blame
this on me!

What?!
Just try saying that again to
my bony face!

Feeble!
Feeble! Feeble! Feeble! Feeble!
Feeble! Feeble! Feeble! Feeble!
Feeble! Feeble! Feeble! Feeble!

Shut up, already!

Grrrr!!!
Don't look at me--I was once
called the best swordsman in all
of Ikana...

The greatest swordsman in all of
Ikana?
You?
Feeeeeeeeble.

...Draw your weapon!

Huh?

I'm telling you to draw your
sword!

......

How?

Rrrrrr-Ah!!!

Will you stop?!!?
What fools!

Haven't you begun to understand?

The kingdom being ruined and us
left in this state...

Isn't it petty, little battles like
this that have caused it?

Believing in your friends and
embracing that belief by forgiving
failure...

These feelings have vanished from
our hearts.

It all happened after somebody
thrust open the doors of that
Stone Tower.

You who bring light into darkness,
I am the King of Ikana Kingdom,
Igos du Ikana.

The spellbinding that had been
cast upon us was broken by that
light which you carry.

To return true light to this land,
you must seal the doors of Stone
Tower where the winds of
darkness blow through.

But Stone Tower is an
impenetrable stronghold. Hundreds
of soldiers from my kingdom would
not even be able to topple it.

It is far too reckless for one to
take on such a challenge.

...And so...

I grant to you a soldier who has
no heart. One who will not falter
in the darkness.

This soldier who has no heart is
your twin image. A shell of
yourself that you will shed when 
your song commands it.

On my kingdom...shine the light
of justice...

The darkness in which my
servants live is, after all, fleeting.

just what kind of thing true
darkness really is.

Wait!
It is my loss!
Sheathe your weapon...

I commanded the Ikana Army of
Ikana Kingdom atop the hill. I am
called Skull Keeta.

Since being shamed by loss in a
battle within my kingdom...

I have waited here for one to
come and awaken my soul.

Young swordsman who has
awakened and deftly defeated
me...

I shall rely on your power to
fulfill my request.

I ask you to take my soul, which
rests in the fiercely burning
flame...

And convey my words to my men,
who, even in death, remain loyal
to me.

Tell them the war has ended...

Then I shall be able to drift
quietly into sleep...

Captain, sir!

May I take leave, sir?

Yes, sir!

Ohhh! Keeta!
Is it not Captain Keeta?!?

...............But you're so...

I was nearly fooled by what you
have done...

If you could not even catch me,
then that must be all the strength
you have.

...T-Tiny!!!

Stop it!

Who are you?
What are you doing just walking
into people's houses like this?

You again? 
Didn't I tell you to leave us
alone?!

Don't!
It's me! It's Pamela!

Get out!
Forget everything you've seen here
and get out!

...Father?

Pamela!

Father!

What have I been doing this whole
time?

You...haven't been doing
anything...

You had a bad dream.
You were just having a little
nightmare.

...Pamela.

Um...What you did for my father...
Thank you.

But...
You helping us...It's a secret from
my father.

Whenever anything strange
happens, my father immediately
starts talking about doing
research...
and he does all kinds of crazy
things, so...

Once he calms down a bit, I think
I'll try convincing him to quit
researching in this dangerous
place and to go back to town.

So...
If my father sees you again...
...I'm sorry.

Your strange power...
If father sees that, he'll surely
want to research it.

That's why...
I don't really want...
you to meet my father...

I'm sorry to say such a thing...

Who are you?
Don't just walk into people's
houses!

Oh!
Isn't this a fairy?

Is this yours, young man?

I am the famed academic who
researches fairies, ghosts and
similar so-called supernatural
phenomena.

By the way, the song, Farewell to
Gibdos, which the music box is
now playing, drives away Gibdos.

I discovered it after many years
of researching Gibdos.

In regards to ghosts, there isn't
another academic who can match
my knowledge, so ask me anything
you like.

...It's been some time since I've a
seen a fairy this lively.

Say, young man!
Would you permit me to do
research on this fairy?

Oh! Hmmmm!
My Ghost Radar is reacting
fiercely.

But...
This is minutely different from its
usual response.

This is a verrrry intriguing
response!

Hmmm...You seem to be both
similar to a ghost and different
from one at the same time...

This is verrry intriguing.

Could you remain here a while and
permit me to research you?

Are you curious about that
picture?

That is a mummified man. Its
scientific name is Gibdo.

A tale in Ikana tells of a treasure
that rests at the bottom of the
well on the hilltop.

It seems the spirits of those who
became Gibdos upon entering the
well in search of that treasure
still linger inside

It's been said going down there is
a petrifying experience. So even
the mummy hunter may become
mummified!

I even tried to go into that well
once myself...

Strangely enough, though, I don't
remember anything that happened
there.

Well, you never know what might
happen, so it's simply best not to
approach it.

Are you curious about that
picture?

That is the ghost of a ninja. Its
scientific name is Garo Robe.

They are merely shells that are
empty on the inside. They're the
shells of spies from an enemy
nation sent to investigate Ikana.
They have been unable to forget
their living days. Even now their
spirits--emptiness cloaked in
darkness--continue to spy.

According to rumor, those Garos
frequently appear near the ranch
on the far side of town.

Although they are said to be
shells, Garos are still ninja and
they will not show themselves in
front of people.

Yet there are many sightings near
the ranch...
That's strange.

Oh! That mask is certainly a
Gibdo!

Young man!
Where did you get that?

Hmmmm...The more I look at it, the
more this mask looks like a real
Gibdo to me.

With this mask, you probably could
convey your feelings to Gibdos.

Perhaps you could even investigate
the Gibdo life-form itself!

Say, young man!
Would you permit me to do
research on that mask?

Aieeyeaaah! Get out!
...It's already too much!

Thanks for stopping!
You're not from here, are you?

I sell Magic Beans to Deku
Scrubs, but I'd really like to leave
my hometown.

I'm hoping to find some success in
a livelier place!

But to open a business in another
place...
You need to go through the 
proper channels first.
Do you know what I mean?

Sorry...but I must get back to
business.

You didn't understand my problem.
Oh, well. Don't pay it any heed.

Oh! That's a Town Land Title
Deed! I wish you'd let me have
that.

I'll give you this land in return!
Deal?

I'm going off to town right now!
I'll leave the rest up to you!

Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business with a focus on
a Deku Scrub clientele.

Actually, I want to do business at
the palace, but there's this big
octopus...and...

Nothing really can be done about
it, so I set up shop here.

Do you know what magic beans
are, sir?
I'll sell you one for 10 Rupees.

Do you need any?
Yes
No

Ah, well, that's too bad.
If you ever want any, look me up.

Oh, you don't know how to use
magic beans? Then, I guess I can't
sell you any...

You don't have enough Rupees!

You can't hold any more magic
beans!

Thanks again!

Thanks for stopping by!

Oh! You're the one who gave me
the land deed.

Thanks to you, I've been able to
do business in the place I've
always dreamed of.

But there aren't many places to
plant beans around here...

Thanks for stopping by!

I just opened for business! I hope
you'll do business with me!

Do you know what magic beans
are?
I'll sell you one for 10 Rupees.

Thanks for stopping!
Who'd have thought I'd meet a
fellow Deku in a place like this?

I sell bomb bags, but I'm focusing
my marketing efforts on Gorons.

What I'd really like to do is go
back home and do business where
I'm surrounded by trees and grass.

But I can't open a business back
home without following the proper
procedures...
Do you know what I mean?

So sorry.
You're not the one I should be
talking to. Pay no attention to me.

That's the deed needed to do
business in town.

I don't like places that busy...

Ah! That's a Swamp Title Deed!
I wish you would give that to me!

I'll give you this land in exchange!

I'm going right back to the
swamp!

Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business with a focus on
a Goron clientele!

I'm sorry, but I can't do business
with you if you're not a Goron.

It's a regulation of the Business
Scrub Association.

It can't be helped.
...It hurts, I know.

Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business with a focus on
a Goron clientele. And that, sir,
makes you a customer.

Right now, I've got a special
trade-in offer just for you.

I'll give you my Biggest Bomb Bag,
regularly priced at 1000 Rupees...

In return, you'll give me your Big
Bomb Bag and just 200 Rupees!

What?
But you already have the Biggest
Bomb Bag!

If you don't have a Big Bomb Bag,
I have to sell it for 1000 Rupees.

Too bad.
You don't have enough Rupees!

Oh, too bad.
Come again!

Thanks to you, I was able to come
back home and do business. I am
really happy!

I'll give you my Biggest Bomb Bag,
regularly priced at 1000 Rupees,
for your Big Bomb Bag and just
200 Rupees!

Thanks for stopping by!
Oh! You're from the mountains.

I'm selling Green Potions, but I'm
focusing my marketing efforts on
Zoras.

Actually, I'd like to do business
someplace where it's cooler and
the air is clean.

That's a...

...Oh, that's a Town Title Deed.
The air's not very good in cities.

That's a...

...Oh, that's a Swamp Title Deed.
I'm not going back home, yet.

So sorry. I've been talking away.
I'm sure this heat is making it
hard to concentrate.

Oh, that's a Mountain Title Deed!
Thank you!

Yahoo!

I'm off to the resort!
The mountains are calling me!

Thanks for stopping by!
I am doing business with a focus
on Zoras!

Sorry, but if you're not a Zora,
I can't do business with you. It's a
regulation of the Business Scrub
Association.
There's nothing I can do...

Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business with a focus on
Zoras. That makes you a
potential customer.

Is this your room?

I'm awfully sensitive to the sea
breeze, so I'm sorry, but I'd like
you to rent this room to me.

...But, my, this is a messy room!
Did something happen in here?
Well, I really can't do anything
about it...

I'll sell you a Green Potion for
40 Rupees!

You get the potion only!
If you don't have an empty bottle,
I can't sell it to you.

Ah, you're the one who gave me
the title deed!

...Thanks to you, I'm doing business
on a mountain so cold I could die!
...What a swindle.

Even if it's just out of pure
stubbornness, I'm going to keep
the shop going...

Brrrrrr...Welcome.
P-please buy something.
G-G-Geeesh...It's...c-cold...

I'll s-sell you one Green P-Potion
for 40 Rupees.

D-Do you need one?
Yes
No

You don't?!?
Y-You know, it's c-c-cold...
D-Don't t-t-talk to me until you
w-want one.

Th-th-thanks...
Brrrrrrrrr...

Thanks for stopping by!
You're from the ocean, aren't you?

I'm here to sell Blue Potion.

Actually, I want to do business in
the sea breeze while listening to
the sound of the waves.

That's a..!

...Oh, that's a Town Title Deed.

The town is too loud to hear the
sound of waves.

That's a...

...Oh, that's a Swamp Title Deed.
Big waves don't reach the swamp.

That's a...

...Oh, that's a Mountain Title Deed.

Sea breezes don't blow on tall
mountains.

So sorry. I guess I've just been
talking about a dream of mine...
Don't mind me...

Oh! If that isn't an Ocean Title
Deed. Let me have that!

Please. If I have that, my dreams
will come true!

I'm not asking for it for free.
I'll give you this!

Oh, yeeeeah!
The nut-brown beauties are
waiting!

Thanks for stopping by!
I'm doing business here in this
canyon.

You should give up going to the
far side of the canyon. That place
is cursed.

If you don't have something that
drives away demons, they'll catch
you.

Rumor has it, demons aren't afraid
unless they see something that
looks the same as themselves.

Don't you need any Blue Potion in
case you get cursed?
One drink is 100 Rupees.

You should give up going beyond
here. If you don't have something
that drives away demons, you'll be
cursed.

Oh, really?
You'll be cursed!

Thanks again!
Drink it right away if you're
cursed!

Thanks for stopping by!

Oh, you're the customer who gave
me the title deed!

Well, technically it is the ocean...

But I'm doing business inside
somebody's room at the ocean.
Well, I don't care whose room this
is. I'm running a business here.

Thanks for stopping by!

I'll sell you one Blue Potion for
100 Rupees.

Well, if you want one, come back!

...Unless I get thrown outta this
place.

Ah! What are you doing here?

This is my secret storage unit.
It's a problem if you come in here
without permission!

Please! I'll sell you a Piece of
Heart if you just keep this place
a secret...

150 Rupees for one!
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

...Hmmm...No good?
In that case, you leave me no
choice...

What about one for 100 Rupees?
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

Well, fine!

I'll make a new storage unit
somewhere else!!!

That's not enough Rupees!

Fine!
This place isn't safe, so I'll move
somewhere else!

It's not that I don't believe you,
but just to be safe, I'm moving my 
storage!

You hurry up and get out, too!

Ah, you...

Yo! Hey, baby!
I'm a stylin' scarecrow wandering
in search of pleasant music.

Time will pass in the blink of an
eye if you dance with me.

If you like, baby, we can forget
the time and dance until night!

Oh, baby!
That's a nice thing you got there!

Let me hear a song you wrote
on that!

No, no, daddy-o!
That song doesn't sing to my
heart, baby!

Yow! Oh, yeah!
That's a nice tune, baby.
By the way...

I know of a mysterious song that
allows you to manipulate the flow
of time...

Oh, yeah!
Now listen up!

If you play that mysterious song
backward, you can slow the flow
of time.

And if you play each note twice
in a row, you can move a half
day forward in time!

How's that? Pretty interesting,
isn't it?

But I like the song you played for
me better, baby!

If you want to see me again, play
that song you wrote for me here
or somewhere else!

See ya, baby!

Yowza! Oh, yeah!
We meet again, baby!
What great playing, as usual!

If you like, baby, we can forget
the time and dance 'til dawn!

But outside it seems to have
gotten kind of...dangerous.
Yikes...I'm gettin' outta town!

Shall we dance?
 
No
Yes

Oh, sorry. That's too bad. In that
case, come back anytime if you do
decide you want to dance.

Oh, yeah!
In that case, forget the time.
Let's dance!

Oh, yeah!
How was it? It went by in an
instant, right?
I'm still full of energy!

By the way...

I know of a mysterious song that
allows you to manipulate the flow
of time...

Do you want to learn it?
 
No
Yes

Oh, sorry. That's too bad.
In that case, let me hear a song
written by you, baby!

Oh, yeah!
Now listen up!

If you play that strange song
backward, you can slow the
flow of time.

And if you play each note twice
in a row, you can move a half day
forward through time.

How's that? Pretty interesting,
isn't it?
But I'm sure I'd like any song
written by you better, baby!
If you like, you can play one
for me!

Take care...

I know of a mysterious song that
allows you to manipulate the flow
of time...

Would you like to learn it?
 
No
Yes

Oh, sorry! That's too bad.
In that case, see you later!

Oh, yeah!
Now listen up!

It seems that if you play that
mysterious song backward, you
can slow the passage of time.

And if you play each note twice
in a row, you can move a half day
forward through time.

How's that? Pretty interesting,
isn't it?

If you learn a new song, come
try it on me. Until then, I'll see ya
later, baby!

Want to learn it?
 
No
Yes

Oh, sorry. That's too bad.

If you'd like to see me again, play
that song you just played for me.
See you later, baby!

OK, it's closing time.
Quick! Get outta here!

Soon, I will unite my spirit to cut
the moon, so you must leave here.

Oh, I'm sorry. It's already time to
close up shop. Come again.

That's all for today, so hurry up
and go home!

It's a Snapper! The way these
things move, they never expose
the weak part of their body!

That's a Mini Baba. It won't attack
unless you get too close to it, so
watch your step!

You've run inside a Mad Jelly.
Since its body is so soft, normal
attacks won't do any good! Figure
out another way!

What?! You don't even know
about the Skulltula? It's protected
by a hard shell, but its stomach
is soft!

That's a Red Chuchu. It's nothing
really to be afraid of! It's not
unusual to find something in its
stomach that might be of use.

Blue Chuchu...
This doesn't have anything inside
of it, so it's really just a blob of
water.

Don't tell me you don't know about
the Deku Baba! Cut it down when
it has extended its body and Deku
Nuts or Sticks will come out.

Bio Deku Baba...
Just calm down and aim carefully!
And don't blame me if one hit
doesn't get rid of it!

Isn't that a Deku Baba?
But it looks a little withered...
Just cut it. You should at least
get a Deku Stick out of it.

It's a Dexihand.
Just be careful...
Look, it's not my fault if you get
too close and it grabs you!

That's a Nejiron.
Don't get too close to it.
Sniff...Sniff...
It smells like gun powder!

That's a Giant Bee.
Don't ask me!
You can either fight or run...
It's up to you.

What?! Don't you know about
the Dodongo? It moves slowly, so
you can circle around to its
backside. Got that?

It's a Deep Python. Get close to
it and stun it. If you fail, it'll
getcha!

Death Armos, a temple guard...
Look at that red mark on its
chest! I know you've seen
something like that before...

What?! Don't you know about
the Dinofols? Use targeting
methods while defending. And 
watch out for its fiery breath!

Don't tell me you don't know about
the Fire Keese! Defeat it before
it swoops down on you.
I do not want to roast!

What?! Don't you know about
the Keese? Use Z Targeting when
it gets close. Even if it flies off,
I'll follow it for you.

You know about the Armos, right?
Shhhh! Don't touch it! Blow it up
before it wakes, please!

That's an Eeno.
It's persistent!
...And it's susceptible to heat!

Isn't that a Dragonfly?
As long as you stay away from
its tail, it's no big danger.

Stick with using the basic
target methods while defending.
...He's a different rank than those
other two lackeys, though...

It said that it's a Garo...
Just concentrate on blocking and
dodging those sharp swords!

That's the Garo Master...
You can't fight him like an
ordinary Garo. Just dodge those
swords...

It's a Wart.
Once you've gotten rid of the
spheres that shield the main body,
you can attack the eye.

It's Gomess. There'll be no end to
it if you can't get those bats
away from it. Does that shed any
light on the situation?

Hurry! Chase after it. Even if it
means throwing your own body
into it, do it so it'll stop!

That's a Blue Bubble!
Quick! Run! Don't let it curse
you! If it comes after you, defend
yourself to block it!

Use Z Targeting methods while
defending...The "Unthinkable?"
What could that possibly be
in a place as dark as this?

Just keep defending and watch his
movements. I think I'm starting to
see his weak point!

What?! Don't you know about the 
Skullwalltula?
...Just don't touch it, all right?

Hurry! Chase him until you get
your chance at him! But if you
get too close, you might regret
it!

It's a Yellow Chuchu.
That's nothing to sweat about.
It usually has something in its
stomach that's of use...

It's a Takkuri.
Run! This bird steals your items!
C'mon! What are you doing just
standing around?!

What?! You don't know about the
Red Bubble? If it comes at you,
get in the defensive position to
bounce it back...Got it?

Hiploops are hotheaded,
so they'll charge if you look it in
the eye. If it comes at you, 
assume the defensive position.

It's a Hiploop. Quickly dodge it
if it charges at you. But can't you
first do something about that
mask it's wearing?

Don't tell me you don't know about
the Shell Blade! It's impossible to
beat it if you aim for anything
but its ligament inside the shell.

If you go near it now, you'll be
eaten! Aim at it from afar to
weaken it.

What are you doing?!?
There's no time to lose! Dive
underwater and attack it!
Hurry!

ReDead...
If it catches you in its paralyzing
glare, you won't be able to move.
Shake it off if you get caught!

It's a Black Boe...
Just calm down and attack it!
Look, there are just a lot of them,
that's all.

It's a Gibdo.
You won't be able to move if it
glares at you, so be careful!
Got it?

Just its head and tail aren't
protected by its hard exoskeleton,
so aim carefully. If only you were
the same size as it...

It's a Wallmaster! Keep an eye
out for it by watching for its
shadow on the floor. Get it before
it goes back up to the ceiling.

You know the Floormaster, right?
If you don't do something about
its pieces before they can 
reunite...

Remember your battles!
When something resistant would
deflect your weapons, what was
its backside usually like?

Remember your battles!
When you fought things that ran
around, didn't you battle them
using your own body?

Think about battles and weapons!
When you had the chance before
an enemy was about to attack,
didn't you usually try shooting it?

You know about the Iron
Knuckle, right? Stay away from
its ax attack, then look for a
chance to retaliate.

You know about the Like Like,
right? It eats whatever you're
carrying. You'd better defeat it if
you want your stuff back.

What?! You don't know about the
Beamos? Don't let its beam
scare you. Just give it a good
blast!

Don't tell me you don't know about
the Freezard! Watch out for its
icy breath! I hate the c-c-cold!

It's a White Boe...
Just calm down and attack it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah...There are just
a lot of them, OK?

You know about the Octorok,
right? All you have to do is
deflect that rock it spits out.

What?! You don't know about the
Poe? If you try to use Z
Targeting, it vanishes.

That's a Gekko.
And it's pretty angry!
It's pretty weak, too. It really
shouldn't be making a fool of you.

Don't you know about the Blue
Tektite? Use Z Targeting to follow
it as it bounces!

You know about the Leever, right?
It actually moves pretty fast.
That's not exactly good news,
is it?

Don't tell me you don't know about
the Pea Hat! Just remember that
its root area is soft!

Pea Hat Larva...You don't know
about it? If it comes at you, get
in the defensive position to knock
it back!

It's an Eyegore.
Simply attacking it is no good.
I say you should pay attention to
the subtle changes in its eye.

It's a Wizrobe.
You'll get your chance right when
it starts to attack. Be on the
lookout for it!

So you don't know about the
Wolfos? Lure it in and watch its
movements. It doesn't like its tail
to be touched...

That's one Mad Scrub!
Even though it's weak, it sure
likes to attack!

It's Meg, eldest of the ghost
sisters. When she multiplies,
look for the real one!!!
Is this it?

It's Jo, second of the four ghost
sisters!. Aim when she appears.
Hurry! There's no time!

It's Beth, third of the four ghost
sisters. Aim when she appears!
Hurry up! There are still more!

It's Amy, youngest of the four
ghost sisters. Target her when
she appears! You got that?

The pirate found you!
Use Z targeting and look for your
chance. You're caught if you don't
win.

It's a Stalchild. They were the
cursed soldiers of the Kingdom of
Ikana...What are you gonna do?

You know about the Ice Keese,
right? Destroy it before it
swoops down on you. I hate the
c-c-cold!

It's a White Wolfos.
Lure it in and watch its
movements. It doesn't like its
tail to be touched...

It's a Guay. You don't know about
this one? Just attack it before it
swoops down on you. That's
all there is to it.

Don't tell me you don't know about
the Big Octo! If you don't want
to be sucked in, keep your
distance. Aim from afar!

You know about the Big Poe,
right? Knock it back to stop it,
then take your shot!

Isn't that a Skullfish?
Look, don't ask me about
everything, all right?

It's a Desbreko.
Once it bites you, it's not gonna
want to let go. I haaaate this
thing!

That's a Green Chuchu.
It's nothing to be afraid of...It
usually has something in its
stomach that's of use.

If you get close to him, you'll be
beaten! Do you understand me?

That's a Gekko.
It gets itself all worked up and
then it just runs around.
I hate it.

It's a Bad Bat. If you don't do
something before it swoops down
on you...Well, just don't come
running to me!

That's a Real Bombchu!
It runs at you with its pack of
explosives, so protect yourself or
else!

If he starts dancing and you don't
run...Well, then I really can't help
you!

Look closely!
The bugs seem to gather around
fire!

The power of this mask allows
you to see what you can smell...

If it's possible, put the scent in
something and take it to the
Magic Hags' Potion Shop.

You learned the Sonata of

This melody awakens those who
have fallen into a deep sleep!

The Lullaby Intro became the
Goron Lullaby...

This lullaby blankets listeners in
calm while making eyelids grow
heavy.

You learned the New Wave Bossa
Nova!

It's the melody taught by the Zora
children that invigorates singing
voices.

You learned the Elegy of
Emptiness!

It's a mystical song that allows
you to shed a shell shaped in

By playing the song while wearing
masks to assume different forms,
you'll be able to leave up to four
empty shells--one for each form!

You learned the Oath to Order!

This melody swoops you up and
sends you soaring to a stone bird

You remembered the Song of
Storms!

This melody that you've heard

You learned the Lullaby Intro!

The soothing melody of a

The wedding ceremony is soon.
It might be early, but I finished
my wedding mask. I wonder if Anju
has made hers?
She tends to do things at the
last minute, so probably not. There
is a gathering of the fellows at
the Milk Bar tonight.
I plan to show off my wedding
mask and talk about my
sweetheart as best I can.

Granny's Diary

We're going to take refuge at
Romani Ranch tomorrow. I guess it
really will fall.

Leaving my lifelong home and
fleeing is unbearable, but nothing
can be done...

I think I'll take several of Gampy's
favorite books.

What's this?
Green clothes...White fairy...
Sir, could you, by chance, be a
forest fairy?
Oh my!

My name is Tingle!
I think I am the same as you, sir.
A forest fairy!

Alas, though I am already age 35,
no fairy has come to me yet...

My father tells me to grow up
and act my age, but why?

I tell you...Tingle is the very
reincarnation of a fairy!

Now while I stand here waiting for
a fairy of my own, I sell maps to
help out my father.

Lucky! Lucky!
You're so lucky to have a fairy! 
I know! I know! We should be
friends!
Yes! Yes! In exchange, I will sell
you a map for cheap as a sign of
my friendship.

Will you buy one of Tingle's maps?

Huh?...A white fairy?

The way you look?
Ohh...Magic, isn't it, sir?

...I see!
Well, call again!

Tingle, Tingle!
Kooloo-Limpah!

...These are the magic words that
Tingle created himself.

Don't steal them!

...Huh?
But you already have that map...

Sir, you don't have enough
Rupees!

Yippee!

Uh, sir?

Hee, hee.
You two fairies did great!

I wonder if he has anything good
on him...

Huh?
This guy...

...Well, that shouldn't be a
problem.

Ooh, ooh! What a pretty ocarina...
Hey, Skull Kid, lemme touch it!
I wanna see!

You can't, Tael!

What would we do if you dropped
it and broke it?
No way! You can't touch it!!!

...Aw, but sis...
W...Why can't I try it out, too?

What's with that stupid horse of
yours?! It doesn't listen to a
word that's said to it...

There's no point in riding a thing
like that, so I did you a favor and
got rid of it...
Hee, hee...

Hee, hee!
Now, that's a good look for you!

You'll stay here looking that way
forever!

Whoa! Whoa! Skull Kid, wait for
me! I'm still here!!!
Tael, you can't leave without me!

S-s...Sis!

You!

If I wasn't dealing with you,
I wouldn't have gotten separated
from my brother!

Well, don't just sit there, Deku
boy! Do something!!!

...Why are you looking at me like
that? What, is there something
stuck on my face?

Will you stop staring and just
open that door for me?!?

Please!!! C'mon, a helpless, little
girl is asking you...
So hurry up!

Ohhhh, Tael...
I wonder if that child will be all
right on his own?

Hey, wait for me!
Don't leave me behind!

So, um... 
That stuff back there...
I...um...apologize, so...
So take me with you!

You wanna know about that
Skull Kid who just ran off, right?

Well, I just so happen to have an
idea of where he might be going.

Take me with you and I'll help
you out. Deal?

Please?

Good! So then it's
settled!

Now then, I'll be your partner...
or at least until we catch that
Skull Kid...

My name's Tatl.
So, uh, it's nice to meet you
or whatever.

Now that we've got all that
straightened out, can we stop
messing around and get moving?

If I figure something out,
press (^) and I'll tell it to you.
Hopefully, you'll manage to get by
without my help until then!

Aww, boo-hoo.
Why the sad face?

I just thought I'd have a little fun
with you...

Oh, come now...
Do you really think you can beat
me as I am now?
Fool!

In the land of Hyrule, there
echoes a legend. A legend held
dearly by the Royal Family that
tells of a boy...

A boy who,
after battling evil and saving
Hyrule, crept away from the land
that had made him a legend...

Done with the battles he once
waged across time, he embarked
on a journey. A secret and
personal journey...

A journey in search of a 
beloved and invaluable friend...

A friend with whom he parted
ways when he finally fulfilled his
heroic destiny and took his place
among legends...

Aah!
He's awake!

You guys...
You hadn't forgotten about me?

You still thought of me as a
friend?

Did you...
Did you save me?

I thought they didn't want to be
friends with me...

But...
They hadn't forgotten about me...

Friends are a nice thing to have...
Heh, heh.

Could you be my friend, too?

Eh-hee-hee...You have the same
smell as the fairy kid who taught
me that song in the woods...

I know, I know!
Let's do something!

Oh...So the evil has left the mask
after all...

Well, now...I finally have it back.

Since I am in the midst of my
travels...

I must bid you farewell.

Shouldn't you be returning home
as well?

Whenever there is a meeting, a
parting is sure to follow.

However, that parting need not
last forever...

Whether a parting be forever or
merely for a short time...
That is up to you.

With that, please excuse me...

...But, my, you sure have managed
to make quite a number of people
happy.

The masks you have are filled
with happiness.

This is truly a good happiness.

Well, both of us have gotten what
we were after...
So this is where you and I part
ways, isn't it?

You know...it was kind of fun.

Well...it's almost time for the
carnival to begin...

So, why don't you just leave and
go about your business?
The rest of us have a carnival to
go to.

Link!

...Thank you.

You've met with a terrible fate,
haven't you?

I own the Happy Mask Shop.
I travel far and wide in search of
masks...

During my travels, a very
important mask was stolen from
me by an imp in the woods.

So here I am at a loss...
And now I've found you.

Now don't think me rude, but I
have been following you...

...For I know of a way to return
you to your former self.

If you can get back the precious
item that was stolen from you,
I will return you to normal.

In exchange...

All I ask is that you also get
back my precious mask that the
imp stole from me.

What?
Is it not a simple task?

Why, to someone like you,
it should by no means be a
difficult task.

Except...

The one thing is...
I'm a very busy fellow...

And I must leave this place in
three days.

How grateful I would be if you
could bring it back to me before
my time here is up...

But yes...You'll be fine.
I see you are young and have
tremendous courage.

I'm sure you'll find it right away.

Well then, I am counting on you...

Why, hello...
Did you find that little imp?

If you can get back the precious
item that was stolen from you,
I will return you to normal.

Surely, you should be able to find
him right away.

Time continues to pass even as
we speak. There are only
� left.

Please...
Do not forget my precious mask.

How did you do?

You'll be fine. Surely, you should
be able to recover Majora's Mask.
I believe in you.

Ah, but time passes even as we
speak...
There are only � left.

Ho, ho, ho...

Were you able to recover your
precious item from that imp?

Oh! Oh! Ohhh!!!
You got it! You got it!
You got it! You got it!!!

Then listen to me. Please play this
song that I am about to perform,
and remember it well...

This is a melody that heals evil
magic and troubled spirits, turning
them into masks.

I am sure it will be of assistance
to you in the future.

Ah, yes. I give you this mask in
commemoration of this day.

Fear not, for the magic has been
sealed inside the mask.

When you wear it, you will
transform into the shape you just
were. When you remove it, you
will return to normal.

Now, I have fulfilled my promise
to you...

So, please, give me that which you
promised me...

Don't tell me...

My mask...

You did...

get it back...Didn't you?

What have you done to me!!!

If you leave my mask out there,
something terrible will happen!

The mask that was stolen from
me... 
It is called Majora's Mask.

It is an accursed item from
legend that is said to have been
used by an ancient tribe in its
hexing rituals.

It is said that an evil and wicked
power is bestowed upon the one
who wears that mask.

According to legend...

the troubles caused by Majora's
Mask were so great...

the ancient ones, fearing such
catastrophe, sealed the mask in
shadow forever, preventing its
misuse.

But now, that tribe from the
legend has vanished, so no one
really knows the true nature of
the mask's power...

...But I feel it.

I went to great lengths to get
that legendary mask.
When I finally had it...

I could sense the doom of a dark
omen brewing. It was that
unwelcome feeling that makes your
hair stand on end.

And now...
that imp has it...

I am begging you!
You must get that mask back
quickly or something horrible will
happen!

Oh, you?

Were you able to get Majora's
Mask back?

You still haven't done it!

I keep telling you that if you don't
get it back soon, terrible things
will happen!!!

Only � remain.
But time is not eternal.
Please make the most of your
time.

Surely you should be able to do
something.

Believe in your strengths...
Believe...

You'll do fine. Surely you will be
able to recover Majora's Mask.

Only � remain.
But time is not eternal.
Please make the most of your
time.
I believe in you.
I will be waiting here for you.
Ho, ho, ho.

Oh, yes. You...
You have the spirit of the Goron
who could not be healed...

So then...
Have you recovered Majora's
Mask?

Oh, that shape?
You have the spirit of the Zora
who could not be healed...

That mask...

Why that's...

Unfortunately, that's not the mask
I am looking for.

You have done some good work...

Keep up that pace. I am counting
on you to get my mask...

That's the Great Fairy's Mask,
isn't it?

That is quite rare.
Normally, you wouldn't be able
to get one of those.

That's the Gibdo Mask, isn't it?

That is a fine mask. It is filled
with the love of a father and
child.

That is the Mask of Truth,
isn't it?

You have a frightful mask. But
being able to see into people's
hearts and minds seems useful...

That's the Giant's Mask, isn't it?

That truly is a rare mask...

That's Kafei's Mask, isn't it?

The worry of a concerned mother
is expressed quite well in that
mask.

That's Don Gero's Mask,
isn't it?

That mask has a very operatic
feel about it.

That's the Blast Mask, isn't it?

That is a fine mask.
It is filled with feelings of
gratitude.

That's the Couple's Mask, isn't it?

That is truly a very fine mask.
It's overflowing with powerful
feelings of love and gratitude.

That is the Mask of Scents,
isn't it?

You've done well to get that mask.
Looking at its condition, I can tell
that its previous owner was neat
and tidy.

That's Kamaro's Mask, isn't it?

That is a fine mask.
It is filled with the joy a teacher
has in finding a good student.

That's the Stone Mask, isn't it?

That is a fine mask.
It is filled with an appreciation
for things that go unnoticed.

That's the Postman's Hat, isn't it?

That is a fine thing.
It is filled with the joy of
freedom.

That's the Bunny Hood, isn't it?

That is a fine thing.
It is filled with kindness towards
animals.

That's the Captain's Hat, isn't it?

That is a splendid thing. It earns
the respect and sworn allegiance
of legions of soldiers.

That is the Bremen Mask, isn't it?

If you have that, then it would
appear you have the qualities of a
leader.

That's the Circus Leader's Mask,
isn't it?

That is a fine mask. It is filled
with the feelings of tenderness
left behind in the back of one's
heart.

That's a Keaton Mask, isn't it?

It carries a lot of nostalgia. It
was popular with children long
ago.

That's the Garo's Mask, isn't it?

If you have that mask, you must
be one with quite a bit of
courage.

That's the All-Night Mask, isn't it?

That looks like an expensive mask.

That's Romani's Mask, isn't it?

That is a nice mask.
It is a sentimental item that
exudes a lot of maturity.

You have done some good work...
You went to a great deal of
trouble, didn't you?

I'm begging you! I'm begging you!
You must do it!

Really?
You'll do it for me?

I was certain you would tell me
that.

You'll be fine! 
Surely, you can do it.

Believe in your strengths...Believe...

You've met with a terrible fate,
haven't you?

So, did you find that little imp?

If you can just get back the
precious item that was stolen
from you, I'll return you to normal.

Surely, you should be able to find
him right away.

Time continues to pass even as
we speak. There is no time to
lose.

Please do not forget my precious
mask...

What are you waiting for?

You'll be fine. Surely, you should
be able to recover Majora's Mask.
I believe in you.

Ah, but time passes even as we
speak...
Your time is almost up.

Ho, ho, ho...

You'll be fine. Surely
you should be able to
recover Majora's Mask.
Yet there's no time left.
But time is not eternal.
Please value your time.
I believe in you. I'll be
waiting here for you.
Ho, ho, ho.

Now no time remains...
And time is not eternal.
Please value your time.

.........

Sis!!!

Ah! Tael!
We've been looking for you two.

Hey, Skull Kid, what if you gave
that mask you're wearing back
now?

Hey, c'mon, are you listening?

Swamp. Mountain.
Ocean. Canyon.
Hurry...The four who are there...
Bring them here...

Don't speak out of line!
Stupid fairy!!!

Nooo!!
What are you doing to my
brother?

Skull Kid, do you still think you're
our friend after that?!!?

...Well, whatever.

Even if they were to come now,
they wouldn't be able to handle
me...
Hee, hee.

Just look above you...

If it's something that can be
stopped, then just try to stop it!

Tael!
Get away from the Skull Kid!

You'll be hit!!!

...I've had enough.

You hit my brother over and over!
I'll never forgive you!!

That won't do you any good.
Hee, hee.

Why are you just standing
around?! Th-there's no time.
You've gotta do something now!

Huh?
When did you get that
instrument?!?

...Tael!

!!!

That's it!
I won't let things go the way you
expect them to!

You are already leaving this land
of Hyrule, aren't you?

Even though it was only a short
time, I feel like I've known you
forever.

I'll never forget the days we
spent together in Hyrule...

And I believe in my heart that a
day will come when I shall meet
you again...

Until that day comes, please...
Take this...

I am praying...
I am praying that your journey be
a safe one.

If something should happen to you, 
remember this song...

The Goddess of Time is
protecting you.
If you play the Song of Time,
she will aid you...

Snap out of it! What are you
doing lost in memories?!?
Get yourself together!

Getting that old ocarina back isn't
gonna help us!!!

Somebody! Anybody!!!
Goddess of Time, help us please!
We need more time!

It...It stopped.

We did it! It stopped!

Sis!!!

Tael!!!

Good...We made it in time.
The giants' call worked on the
Skull Kid.

Hey, Skull Kid!
Do you realize what you've been
doing to everyone?!?

I figured it out!
So, c'mon...Apologize to everyone!!

Wait...Sis...Don't...
Don't be so hard on the Skull Kid.

Tael! Why are you protecting him!
Aren't you mad at him for hitting
you so much?

He was lonely...
...the Skull Kid.

He was trying to destroy
everything around him!
That is not the same as a lonely
child! We can't allow that!

The power of the mask made him
do it. It was too much for the
Skull Kid to handle.

It's 'cause he doesn't know his
place! On top of having a weak
will and no strength of heart...
he's a fool!

Certainly,
he had far too many weaknesses
to use my power.

Yeah! That's right! Admit your
stupidity!

...Huh?

A puppet that can no longer be
used is mere garbage.

This puppet's role has just ended...

It can't be!
Then that moon?

I...I shall consume.
Consume...Consume everything.

Waahhhhh! This isn't good!
Let's go back! Let's go back!
Hurry! The Song of Time!
The Song of Time!!!

Aw, no....
You've got to be kidding. Don't tell
me you're going up there...

I won't do it!
You go by yourself!
I'm staying here with Tael.

I'll go!!!

What?!
What are you saying, Tael?
Is something wrong with you?

I don't always want to be running
away!

If only I had been stronger, the
Skull Kid wouldn't have...

I understand. I'll go!

After all this time, Tael, you've
gotten really stubborn...
Just like someone else I know...

You know, you guys are really
stupid...

It stopped.

I think we're getting used to this!

Well...Now you should be awake...
Stand up!!!

Wait...Sis...
The Skull Kid...Don't blame him!

Yeah, yeah. I know...
The Skull Kid was lonely 'cause
nobody would be his friend.
Blah, blah, blah...

And the power of the mask made
him do it 'cause it was too much
for him to handle...

How?
...How did you know that, sis?

Get back, Tael!

Don't worry.
Just leave it to your sister!

Well? You're going in, aren't you?

...We can't do anything down here.
Let's go!

I've been thinking this ever since
I joined you...

You never want to give up.
You always want to try.
I admire you!

Are you ready?
All right, but if something bad
happens to you, don't blame me...

Wait...Listen...
It seems to be saying something...

Could that crying be its way of
teaching us some sort of melody?

Don't just stand there...
Get your instrument...

"Call us."
...That's what it's saying.

W-What exactly are all of you?

"Guardians."
Guardians?

So...You're protective gods?

That's why you're in the temples...
But...why are the protective
gods...?

No, wait! Are you listening to
me? Hey! 
 
Wait...

Hey, listen. We want you to lend
us your power!

If you just leave things as they
are, something terrible will happen
to this world!

Surely, you're the only ones who
can stop it!

That's what Tael was trying to
tell us!

"Help our friend."

I get it.
We have to help the last one!

Then promise us this...
You'll cooperate with us...

Well, we've helped all of you.

That's all we can do.

"Call us."
 
That's what they're saying.

Without being told, we understand.
So now you'll help us out in
exchange!

We'll call you from atop the
Clock Tower, so do something
about him, all right?

What? Their voices sound sad...
You don't want to?

"Forgive your friend."
Forgive our friend?

What do you mean by forgive?
Huh? What friend?

What's that?

Ye who hold my remains...

Return to the appointed place to
face me...

It seems the crows that fly near
the town walls are fond of
musical instruments...

The Swamp Tourist Center will not
accept pictographs taken outside
the swamp.

But if you bring a pictograph of
the guide's son, he'll give you
something nice...

The frogs that are supposed to
gather in the mountains when
spring arrives are elsewhere.

You need Don Gero's mask to
bring them together.

The frogs in Clock Town, the
swamp, Woodfall Temple and
Great Bay Temple make four...

The gold dust won as the prize in
the Goron Races in spring can be
used by the smithy to forge a
sword.
Or it can be sold to the smithy
for 40 Rupees, but the Curiosity
Shop will buy it for 200 Rupees...

To get Evan to listen to Mikau
and Japas's song from their music
session, you should not try
demonstrating it as Mikau.

unrelated to the band and begin
playing it, you just might get
him to lend an ear.

If you use the Lens of Truth near
here and speak to the man you
find...

you may earn a mask that can
enable you to blend into
backgrounds and move about
without being noticed.

much...

house, comes out every two
minutes when the music box is

out if she hears a bomb
explode...

Bar member if you do a good deed
at the ranch.

frequently mixes up guests...

the thief, is tucked away at the
edge of Ikana Canyon...

of making young animals mature.

who died in Termina Field dances
there night after night.

The reward for Romani's
nighttime assistant seems to be
something that holds milk...

It seems the veranda door of the
town's Stock Pot Inn has
carelessly been left unlocked...

The postman puts his delivery
schedule before everything else,
but priority mail is of even
greater importance.

called the All-Night Mask seems
to be available at the Curiosity
Shop...

It seems that drinking Chateau
Romani makes your magic power
last for three days...

It seems Keaton, the ghost fox,
plays tricks in the grass...

The Fierce Deity Mask, a mask
that contains the merits of all
masks, seems to be...
somewhere in this world...

A small, lost horse seems to have
been taken in by Romani Ranch,
south of town...

The mask that can see into
people's hearts and minds also
seems to work on animals
as well...

It's like my heart is being peered
right into. That's a disturbing eye!

The mystical stone responds to
the mask and speaks to you.

...But its words are heard in
secret...

Only � remaining!

The mask that sees into people's
hearts seems to be near the
strange, shining, gold spiders...

The cute boy's mask seems to
have been made by an important
man's wife...

The weird mask that disrupts
sleeping habits seems to be 
found in a suspicious shop that
opens only at night...

man with the scary face but
kind heart has the wild ears that
hear well...

popular with children long ago is
being cherished by the owner of
the suspicious shop...

The suspicious brothers seem to
have a mask once used for spying
activities...

It seems the girl who smells of
the ranch has a mask that only
adults have...

The mask that trickles out
troubles from its face seems to
be held by the greatest of
traveling men...

It seems the person who is
conscientious about being on
time...

can see into the boxes that
enable people to keep in touch
with other people's feelings.

It seems the two who have most
reason to have it are indeed the
ones who have the mask that is
full of a man and woman's love...

to have a mask that calms those
scattered in temples...

who's devoted to her parent is
being forced to wear a frightening
mask...

hunger seems to have a mask
that gathers voices to sing...

about seems to have a mask
that animals follow obediently...

explosives has a dangerous mask
filled with gunpowder...

He of high class and manners who
lives in the swamp has a useful
mask that distinguishes scents...

A mask that contains gigantic
power seems to be resting in the
temple of the accursed land...

It seems all the strange stones
that are arranged in a row
wish to be the same color.

It seems the face of the slightly
larger, strange stone changes
when the guitar of waves is
played...

It seems the face of the slightly
larger, strange stone changes
when the pipes of awakening are
played...

It seems the face of the slightly
larger, strange stone changes
when the drums of sleep are
played...

strange, sparkling gold spiders had

Will you play...with me?
Yes
No

You're a boring kid.

You have only weak masks...

So...you'll play?
Yes
No

...You're a coward.

Well...

Shall we go?

...Everyone has gone away,
haven't they?

Will you play...with me?
Yes
No

You're a boring kid.

You don't have any masks left,
do you?

Well, let's do something else.

Let's play good guys against
bad guys...
Yes. Let's play that.

Are you ready?
You're the bad guy.
And when you're bad, you just
run. That's fine, right?

Well...

Shall we play?

Your real face...
Show it to me...

...

Ahhh...
Nice weather...Isn't it?

Masks...You have...a lot.
You, too...Will you be...
a mask salesman?

Then I'll play with you.
So...The masks...Give me some...

The kid sitting beneath the tree...
He's calling you...

That's...wrong...

Not that!

Hurry...Put it away...

More...

Thanks...
You...You're nice person...
Aren't you?

Hide-and-seek...Let's play.

All right...I'll...hide...

...Shall we...play again?
Yes
No

You won't...play?

Oh...

Hide-and-seek...Let's play...

All right...I'll...hide.

That mask...
Take it off...

Well...Shall we go back?
Yes
No

You're not...going back?

...
You found me...

Hey...
I want...more...masks...

That's...wrong...

...No?
Oh...

Are you...going back?
Yes
No

You're not...going back?

Not that!

Hurry...Put it away...

More...

Heh, heh...Thanks...
You're...nice.

Umm...
Can I ask...a question?

Your friends...
What kind of...people are they?

I wonder...
Do those people...
think of you...as a friend? 

You...
What makes you...happy?

I wonder...
What makes you happy...
Does it make...others happy, too?

The right thing...What is it?

I wonder...
If you do the right thing...
Does it really make...
everybody...happy?

Your true face...
What kind of...face is it?

I wonder...
The face under the mask...
Is that...your true face?

No using masks in the store
because of past indiscretions!

Kafei!
No, I don't know any such kid.
I kid you not!

If you wear something like that,
you'll never be able to sleep.
I kid you not!

Hey, that's nice...
Maybe I can start carrying that in
my store...
I kid you not!

This isn't "members-only," so take
that thing off.
I kid you not!

That's great for a young kid.
Delivery is hard work.

Oh! Who's the lucky lady?
Congratulations.

My shop is small, so don't go
dancing up a storm in here!

That is one bizarre getup you've
got on your head. Take it off...

That's weird!
I thought somebody had walked in
here.

Ah, well. I have to get ready for
the night shift, anyway.

Don't go leading some parade
through a little place like this.

Careful! Don't go blowing yourself
up in a place like this...
I kid you not!

Nah, I don't know that kid. And,
the manager's not here now, so I
really can't help you.

I'm, like, embarrassed to wear
that, so I'm not gonna be a
member...

I entered to win some concert
tickets...Don't ya have anything
to deliver to me?

Ahh, I wanna find a girlfriend and
get married soon, too...

Whoa! Is that a skull?
That's cool!

...

We don't get many customers, so
why does the boss have so much
money?

Isn't that, like, kind of dangerous?

Oh my! You've collected some
weird masks!

Oh, Kafei?
The mayor's son...
Now that you mention it, I haven't
seen him lately.

Oh...You've collected some nice
masks!

Oooh! That's sooo cute!
I want to eat it!

Oh! You've collected some cute
masks!

Oh, are you a member of Latte,
little guy? That's great!

Oh, the Circus Leader's Mask!
He comes here a lot.

He always says how his brothers
are at the ranch...

Oh, nice job on those deliveries.
So, do you wanna play?

But not when you're on the job,
right?

Oh, that's nice.
Who's getting married?

Oh, you're quite pretty...
But aren't I prettier?
Just kidding...

Well, you've collected some
frightful masks!

I can't stand...frogs.

What should I do for today's
treasure chest prize? 

...I know, I'll give a good prize to
someone who pays a lot...

Hey, where did you get that
mask? C'mon, tell me!

I used to see him by the Laundry
Pool sometimes. Hey, who is
he? What did he do?

I'm full of energy without even
wearing that mask!

I have that too!

You're a grown-up!

You can look in the postboxes...
I wish I could!

We're too young for that mask!

........?

I don't need a weird mask like
that!

Where did you get that mask?

I dunno!

I don't have that one!

I want one, too!

I have it, too!

It's scary!
Take it off!

If I have to wear that thing when
I become a grown-up, then I just
wanna stay a kid...

I wanna be one when I grow up,
too.

My mom and dad have that!

That's sc-scary!
You surprised me...

I-Is s-someone...there?

I don't need that weird mask!

Say...
Where did you get that mask?

That's Romani's Mask. Only adult
customers can get that mask.

But "adults" isn't really the right
term. It's not based on age, but
on a person's way of thinking and
acting...
Hee, hee. Somewhere, there's
a person who thinks of you as an
adult.

Umm...
That...
Do you...?

Ah...You.
Did some middle-aged woman put
you to work?

Kafei isn't here...

Oh my? The Couple's Mask?
Someone got married.

My friend is going to be married
soon, too...Soon...

That mask?
Oh, that's right. The town should
be having its carnival soon.

Oh, Dotour...

If they pick on you, you come tell
teacher, OK?

!!!
The mayor's son?
No good runnin' off before the
ceremony!
...I wish I could get mad, but my
own sons ran off in a hurry
before the carnival...

What a shame! I could cry!

Hey! We have a no-mask policy...
Wha??

I didn't think I'd see nobody
wearin' a mask like that no more,
but here's one.

So Dotour's wife is makin' you
search for him with this, eh?

Doesn't look a thing like 'im,
really. Then again, I guess it does,
so...um...
Hey...uh...I want you to leave now.

Lookee here!
Don't be in'erfer'in with my dear
Anju!!! You 'fraid o' my fists?
Don' go findin' that Kafei!

I saw him somewhere...
It was somewhere around here...

Sorry, I'm busy.

Ohh, how many people are gonna
ask me that? That lady is so
persistent.

Soooo, doesn't Kafei want to
break off his engagement to
Anju? Why not let him? That's
what he wants... 
Some people...

You're the one my wife has hired?
So Kafei still hasn't...hmmm.

This is a secret, so don't tell
my wife.

Go ask at the Curiosity Shop, the
store in the west part of town
that only opens at night. That
guy is a bad influence on me...

...I don't know where he is.
Even if I knew, it would be a
secret.

Kafei?

I can recall when he was in the
Bombers.

Don't see his face much anymore,
though...Well, what could he be
doing?

Try asking the children. The
Bombers know all about what goes
on in town.

I used to see him at the Laundry
Pool a lot.

What? Oh, a mask?
I've seen a real Keaton near the
slide!

Act your age!
Don't be a crybaby!

.........???

You can't aim for the targets
when you're wearin' a mask, sonny.
Take it off.

Ah, Kafei, eh?
He hasn't come here.

Eeesh! You can't aim for the
targets wearin' somethin' like that
monstrosity on your head, sonny.
Take it off.

.........

C'mon! Play the game wi'out
wearin' a mask like that!

I don' know that kid.
Nevah seen 'im b'foah in me
life.

Aye, Congratulations!
Who's gettin' married?
Awn't they gonna 'ave a big
ceremony?

Nice! Tha's a beauty!

C'mon! Play the game wi'out
wearin' a mask like that! Yoiks!

(+) forward and press (B) to
perform a thrust.

And finally, the jump attack.
Press (A) after drawing your
sword and Z-Targeting with (Z).
Begin.

Draw your sword, press (Z) to
Z-Target, then press (A) to
perform the jump attack.

Well done!
Do not forget what I have taught
you thus far and do not neglect
your daily practice!
Ah, yes, you can press � to
defend yourself with your shield.
Did you know that?

Wrong!

You must release (Z) and press
(A) to put away your sword!

Do not Z-Target!

Fool!
What can I teach to one who has
no sword?!?

...Hmmm. Impressive.
I must give you something.
Here!

Your training is insufficient. You
must jump more!

Start over from the beginning.

Unbelievable...
Cherish it well...

What? Have you some kind of
complaint?

This is a training center for
learning the sacred way of the
sword. It is no place for children!

This is a place for studying the
way of the sword. It is no place
for children to play!

If you wish to study the way of
the sword at this training center,
come after you've become an
adult.

Umm...Excuse me, but this is a
training center for studying the
way of the sword...

I can't help those without a
sword.

This training center is for
studying the lowly sword...It is no
place for one of your stature, sir.

Here...those who have no sword...
cannot...I'm sorry, but it's the
regulations.

How unfortunate it is, since you
seem to have good skill, but this
is a center for studying the way
of the sword.
If you don't have one...
But if you have a friend who
wants to study, tell them we have
a special discount going on.

Regrettable. If only you had a
sword, you could become a sword
master, like myself...

And it's even a bargain now with
our special discount...

At my training center, you could
become a master right away...

Too bad you have no sword.

The Expert Course is a practice
session!

Cut down the 10 logs using the
highly difficult techniques!

If you score a perfect 30 points,
you shall be taught all the
secrets!

Have you prepared?

Uuuuurgh...I'm scared!
I can't take it!
I don't want to die!

This is a training center for the
sacred sword!
What is that mask?

Is that the manner of one who
wishes to study the sword?!
Come when you are ready!

I do not know that child.

Why do you wear the
All-Night Mask?

Are you suggesting that my 
instructions will put you to sleep?
How rude! Be gone!

Ohh, how adorable!
Let me tug on your long ears...

Ahem...If you study the way of
the sword here, you'll get your
bunny dirty, so put it away.

.........

This is a training center for
studying the way of the sword, so
I will teach anyone who has a
sword... 
But first, leave that mask at
home...

Why do you wear a ninja's mask?
Do you wish to become a ninja in
the future?

How nice. The innocence of
children...

......
 Do you really wish to study the
sword?

I can't find the will to teach you
when their milk has no freshness...

This is a training center for
studying the sacred sword!
Why that mask? How ugly and
sorrowful.
If you wish to study the sword,
first remove that strange
plaything.

Ahh...You always do a wonderful job
delivering the mail.

Oh, congratulations.
Did a friend get married?
Mmm...To be young...

Hey, that's not bad. That girl's
mask is very beautiful! I'll lose my
focus if I try to instruct you
while you're wearing that.
Leave it at home.
Or...I could keep it for you.

Frightening! That mask!
It's frightening!!!

That scares me.
Take it off! Take it off!

I'm no good at singing, so I won't
sing. Not even if you wear that!

......
Why that mask?
Are you making fun of me? If
you're making fun of me, be gone!

Waaah!

If you wish to study the way of
the sword, remove that mask! It
looks like something I saw in a 
bad dream...

Hmm?
...Is someone there???

This is a training center for the
sacred sword!

Do not wear that mask and march
around in here! If you wish to do
that, go outside!

This is a training center for
teaching the sacred sword!
Why do you wear that mask?

I cannot allow such an evil weapon
in here. Come back when you are
ready!

This is the training center of the
sacred sword! Why do you wear
that mask?

I am not stinky!
I take a bath at least once a
month!

I'm currently on the job.
If I stop to talk, it will disrupt my
schedule.

According to my schedule, it is
now my nap time.

If my schedule is disrupted by
even a few seconds, letter
delivery will be delayed...
Public service is very hard.

This is a problem...A real problem.
Not a single letter was mailed...

What should I do this afternoon...
I wish someone would tell me.

...You're disrupting me!

Last night, I wrote a letter to
myself and deposited it in a post
box...

I just retrieved it. This afternoon,
I shall deliver that letter!
Hrr, hrr!

To Myself,
You have been doing a great job
delivering the mail.

I have a request for my
hard-working self. All of the
townsfolk have taken refuge.
I want myself to flee, too.
Even if it is not written on the
schedule, I want myself to flee.
Please...
                  From Me

Ohhh...I want to flee!
B-but, it's not written on the
schedule.

T-to me, the delivery schedule...
It's the h-highest priority.

T-to me, the delivery schedule...
It's the h-highest priority.

Th-this is a priority mail seal!
This is the highest of priorities.
I shall deliver it!

I have a delivery for you,
Postmaster!!!

I have decided to flee.
It is an order from the
Postmaster.

I am now free! I can set my own
schedule!

There was only one letter today.
It is so sad...

But I shall deliver it perfectly.

I have a letter for you.

...It seems he is out today.

Deposit mail here.
Ka-ching!

I cannot accept anything other
than letters.
Ka-ching!

Thank you for using the postal
system.
Ka-ching!

Your letter has been received.
Ka-ching!

It shall be delivered this
afternoon.
Ka-ching!

It shall be delivered tomorrow.
Ka-ching!

4, 5, 6...

Whaa!
...You startled me.

Do not disrupt my training!

In my mind, I am running for
exactly 10 seconds without looking
at a clock.

I was in the middle of mental
training!

You may make fun of me, but this
is quite difficult!

Will you try?
Yes
No

Then you are disrupting me!

Press (A) to start.
Count 10 seconds, and the precise
moment you think you've hit 10
on the dot, press (A) again.

Your time was �.

Huh?!?
10 seconds?!?

That is amazing!
You have reflexes suitable for a
postman!

As thanks for showing me
something impressive, I give you
this.

I can't be like this!
I'll have to train more! More!

Oh! Almost!
That was a close one...

...Oh, nothing. Just talking to
myself.

See! I told you it's difficult!

You're past 10 seconds!

My, you're a slow one.

You look like you want to try
again...

I'll let you try, but it will cost
2 Rupees!

Will you still try again?
Yes
No

Grr! You're disrupting my training!
Shoo, shoo!

You don't have enough Rupees!
Hrrrrr...You're disrupting my
training!

Whaa!
What...You again?!?

Don't keep disrupting my training!

So...

In my head, I run for exactly
10 seconds without looking at a
clock. I'm in the middle of 
mental training!

I can let you do it, but it will
cost 2 Rupees!

Whaa! Those ears!!!
Oh, they're fake...
You startled me!

Don't disrupt my training!

You are doing a great job.
Ka-ching!

Some item other than a letter has
been deposited.
Ka-ching!

Nice work.
Ka-ching!

Please take priority mail to the
Post Office. It will even be
accepted late at night.
Ka-ching!

I have a delivery for you,
Postmistress!

Oh my, it can't be!
You're still here?

To...to...to...tomorrow's delivery is
still scheduled!

What are you saying?!?
Did you see the sky?
It's terrible!

But, but...

Oh, my! Well!!!
What shall we do?!?
It's from Kafei!

It's priority mail.

I'm so happy!
To think something good would
come in the end!

Thank you.
You flee now.
That's an order!

Understood.

I don't need this anymore, so
here...I'll let you have it!

Ehhhh, I'm sorry...
Only Deku Scrubs can play here.

Young Link, you will compete
against your best time.

How about it? Will the young one
play?

Young Link, you will compete
against your best time.

Try setting a new record again
today, young Link.

How about it? We're open only
until the carnival, which is the
day after tomorrow. So will the
young one play?

Young Link, you will compete
against your best time.

Good luck, young Link.
Now you can try for three
straight days of new records.

Even though today is actually the
eve of the carnival, it's quiet
above and no one's come down
here yet.
Will you play, young Link?

Even though today is actually the
eve of the carnival, no one has
come in. That's quite rare.

Now is your chance, young one.
Will you play?

One game is 10 Rupees.
 
I'll play
No thanks

Come again.

You don't have enough Rupees!

All right, then. Use this Deku
Flower and have fun.

If the time it takes you to get all
the Rupees is faster than the
current record, you get an
extravagant prize.
But if you fall down below just
once, it's over!

The best time for today's game is
�.
Get all the Rupees faster than
that.

The best time for today's game is
�.
Get all the Rupees faster than
that.

The best time for today's game is
�.
Get all the Rupees faster than
that.

Time's up.
You're done!

Too bad.
You can compete as many times
as you like, though.
Hee, hee.

Too bad.
You're done!

You can compete as many times
as you like, though.
...If you have Rupees.
Hee, hee.

�
Amazing...It's a new record!

...Take this.

Come again, young Link.

I'll record this time.
So what's your name, young one?

Hmm, hmm...Link?
...That's a strange name for a
Deku Scrub.

If you can, come by again
tomorrow.

�
...Amazing. A new record...
And for three days straight?!?
Wow...We've been had.
Well, you're obviously a pro, and
pros can't play here.
Take this and don't come back.

Such a youthful face...
...But we were really dealing with
a fierce competitor!

Ahh! It's Link!
Hide!

It's time to change the setup!
Go home!

OK, it's all over!

�
Well, that's the way it goes.

OK, burrow into the Deku Flower.
The game begins the moment you
jump out!

It looks like we have a visitor,
Honey.

I wonder if it's a customer,
Darling?

But from what I see, he doesn't
have a bow, Honey.

Oh...Then he can't play, can he,
Darling?

What should we do, Honey?
Surely this one doesn't have a
bow, so he can't play here...

Oh...Too bad. But, Darling, even if
he doesn't have a bow, he could
play if he had some sort of way
of shooting at things...

What shall we do, Honey?
I don't think this one can use a
bow...

But it looks like he can shoot
bubbles, so let's let him play,
Darling.

Oh, will the little Deku Scrub play
again?

Target shooting runs until tonight,
so why don't we let him play,
Darling?

Would you like to play?
This time it's special...

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it Darling?

But from what I can see, he
doesn't seem to have a bow,
Honey.

Oh my...Then he can't play today,
can he, Darling?

Oh, is this the one who got a
perfect score, Honey?
Do you want to play again?

The Bombchu Gallery runs until
tonight, doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

The Bombchu Gallery runs until
tonight, doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

Today is Bombchu Gallery day,
isn't it, Darling?

But from what I can see, he
doesn't seem to have a Bomb Bag,
Honey.

Oh my...Then he can't play today,
can he, Darling?

Did you just get a perfect score?
Do you want to play again?

Basket Bomb runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score yesterday? Do you
want to play again?

Basket Bomb runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score yesterday? Would
you like to play again?

Today is Basket Bomb day, isn't it
Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

Basket Bomb runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, would you like to play?

Today is Basket Bomb day, isn't it
Darling?

Ahh! You again?
You still want to play?

.........

Oh, are you the one who just got
a perfect score? Would you like
to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score two days in a row?
Do you want to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, are you the one who got a
perfect score two days in a row?
Do you want to play again?

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it, Darling?

Oh, do you want to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, aren't you...
You're the one who got a perfect
score before, right? Want to play
again?

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it, Darling?

Oh, do you want to play again?

Target Shooting runs until tonight,
doesn't it, Darling?

Oh, do you want to play?

Today is Target Shooting day, isn't
it, Darling?

What shall we do, Honey?
From what I can see, he doesn't
seem to be able to carry bombs.

Oh my...Then he can't play, can he,
Darling?

One game is 10 Rupees.
 
I'll play
I won't play

Honey, he says he isn't playing...

It looks like he doesn't have
enough Rupees. What shall we do,
Honey?

Goodbye!

Hit all the targets in the time it
takes us to dance through one
song.

But if you fall from this platform,
you're out. Isn't he, Darling?

Hit all the targets in the time it
takes us to dance through one
song.

But if you fall from this platform,
you're out. Isn't he, Darling?

Get a bomb inside every basket in
the time it takes us to dance
through one song.

If you throw with too much power,
you'll fall off this platform, so be
careful. Right, Darling?

Hit each target with a Bombchu in
the time it takes us to dance
through one song.

But if you fall off this platform,
you're out. Right, Darling?

Are you ready?
Start the music!

Did you see that? Honey, he got
a perfect score...

We have to share our happiness
with him, Honey.

That's annoying, so let's show off
even more for him, Darling.

H-H-Honey!!!
He...He got a perfect score three
days in a row.

This is all we have left to give
him, Honey.

I wonder...
Are we truly happy?
...Darling?

I wonder...
Are we truly happy?
...Darling?

Honey,
It's a perfect score again...

.........

All done.

It's already over, Honey.

For a while, it was like a dream,
Darling.

Oh, that's why I told you...

We've already won, Honey.

I'm happy, Darling.

That hurts!

Welcome to the Stock Pot Inn...

Um....Are you...staying the night?
Yes
No

...Eh?!?
You are...staying the night?

I'm terribly sorry! There are
no vacancies today...
We've been booked solid with
reservations.
It's always this way before the
carnival. I'm sorry.

I recommend making a reservation
the next time you wish to stay
here.

Oh, really...That's good...

We're always totally booked right
before the carnival. We're sorry
we have to turn people away...

I recommend making a reservation
if you plan to stay with us during
this season.

Please pay the Stock Pot Inn a
visit in the future.

Umm...Are you...staying the night?

Oh my!
I wonder...Did I by chance ask you
the same thing earlier?

My mother is always telling me to
remember our customer's faces,
but I tend to forget them...

Please enjoy the Carnival of Time.

Umm...Did you...have a reservation?
Yes
No

You do have a reservation?
That's good...

Mr. Link, is it?
One moment, please.

Mr. Link,
I have you down for an afternoon
arrival.

Your room is our "Knife Chamber"
on the second floor. Here is your
key.

Have you been to the Clock Tower
plaza yet?

They are now putting together
what has become the carnival's
custom.

It should be wonderful this year,
too.

I hope you enjoy our tradition.

Please relax...

Good night...

The city is so busy it's hard to
find one's way-goro...

I'm terribly sorry. There are no
vacancies today...We're booked
solid with reservations.

I should have a reservation-goro.
The name is Link.
Don't you have it-goro?

Mr. Link.
Ah! I do have your reservation.

Your room is our "Knife Chamber"
on the second floor. This is your
room key.

This place is falling apart. The
floor looks like you could pull it
up-goro...

I made a reservation...
The name is Link-goro!

Mr. Link-goro?
I don't have a reservation under
that name.

There is one close to that, but...

What?!?
Really-goro?
Well, it's nice weather, so I'll just
sleep outside-goro.

I'm terribly sorry.

It's a hard world to live in-goro...

Ah!
Uh, uh, uh, umm, umm...
What is this?

I have delivered this to you!

Ah! Wait!

This letter, wh-where did you?!?

From the postbox.

Th-that's not what I mean!
From the postbox where?!?

From the postbox somewhere.

That's not what I mean!

It will be lunchtime soon.
I must hurry up and cook.

...Grandmother is surely waiting.

I must hurry!
The guest arriving in the
afternoon will come.
Skip this, skip that!

We used to be a cafeteria, but
after my father died, the room
rentals that were part of our
service became our main focus.
We're just a small inn with only
2 rooms, but people from all over
come here at this time of year...

See the performers practicing
outside? The second floor bunk
room guests are very spirited at
night with songs and dancing.

The customer coming this
afternoon will be staying next
door to them, so I hope it'll be all
right.

Mmm...Mmm?

Please don't talk to me...
I'm about to drop this plate...

Oh, Tortus.
I've already had lunch.

Grandmother...I am Anju!
Tortus was my dad...

And you haven't had lunch yet!

I've already had lunch.
Now be quick and take that away.

Not eating is bad for you.
Please eat...

Didn't I say that I already ate
lunch, Tortus?!?
Impossible child!

Then don't eat my food.
I give up...

Whew!

"Whew?"

Er...
W-W-Whewwwould you like me to
read you a story?

Oh...That mask...

You, too...
You're also looking for Kafei.

You're also looking for Kafei?

I have a request!
Kafei...I have a clue...that will help
you find him.

Tonight at 11:30, please come to
our kitchen.
We'll talk then...

I will try to find him myself.
Asking someone else to do it...
I can't do that!

I can't find him...
Kafei...

Where...
I wonder where he could have
gone...

And there's only a little time left
before...
our wedding...

Ah! ...Umm...Never mind!

I am sorry to trouble you late at
night. It's about him...Kafei.

I received a letter from...him.

Strange...Isn't it?
Getting a letter from a missing
person...

But there's absolutely no mistaking
it's from him!

It's clear...to me...

Please!

Here is my letter.
Please put this in a postbox.

When this is delivered...When he
receives my letter... You should be
able to meet him!

Please tell him that Anju is
waiting for him.

And please, after you've seen
him...
Tell me how he looked.

I'm scared...I...I can't go.

Can I ask this of you?
Yes
No

Thank you...very much.

Please mail it immediately in the
morning.

...Uh, umm...Aren't you going to
take refuge?

...Ah...Today's weather is
unfortunate, isn't it?

I have decided to wait for him.
I've made my promise...

I'm fine with this.
I believe him.

Oh...

Did you...see him?

...I'm sorry. It's too late, isn't it?

Oh...

Did you...see him?

...I'm sorry.
It's probably too soon to ask...

Oh...

Did you meet him?

Ah!

...It's from Kafei.
Th...Th...Thank you...
Very much!

Umm...What's that?

Excuse me.
Have you seen a man in this
area?

He looks like this...

He...disappeared about one month
ago with his wedding ceremony
mask.

I'm...actually...afraid to meet him...

and to hear the reason why he
wanted to disappear...

It might be because of... me...

There are only two days until the
carnival...
Should I wait?
Kafei...

Ah! That mask...
You're looking for him, too.

I came here thinking I would look
for him myself, but...

What a ramshackle inn. Is this
room first-class? You can hear
whoever's next door for cryin' out
loud!
Well, whatever...We're staying for
free, so we can't expect much.

See, everything here is falling
apart...You can hear the voices
next door.

OK, Anju, we're leaving in the
evening for the ranch.

Cremia will take us in. She is
your best friend, right?

I wonder if Kafei is really at
Cremia's place...

If Kafei is there, your mother will
give him a smack.

Besides, think about Cremia. She
needs strength from a partner and
business support from Madame
Aroma.
If Kafei really has run off with
Cremia, she'll get both. Please
don't be sad. How happy could 
you possibly be...
marrying a man who runs off
when he's about to be married?
It would make your life unhappy
...just like your mother's.

But in the letter it said he 
definitely would come back...

Come back to what??
Won't this town be crushed
beneath the moon the morning
after tomorrow?
Forget about that letter. For now,
just try to survive.
Everything else will follow...

Yes...
Mother, Thank you.

Everyone will be taking refuge
first thing in the morning. 
Everything was supposed to be all
so...spirited...It's sad.

We'll be going to Romani Ranch in
the evening to take refuge. I think
you should all hurry too.

Perhaps I was wrong...

But he said so...
The morning of the ceremony...
He'd come meet me in my room...

And I promised him I would wait...
But...already...it's too late, isn't it?

Anju stayed in her room to wait
for Kafei...

It's foolish to believe a man
like that.

I too believed my husband would
return out of the blue...

Oh, Anju...
That child's naive sense of trust
may be my fault.

!!!

...I've been a little harsh on Anju.
...But, it's fine this way.

Right now, surviving is the
important thing.

I'm sorry.
We're going to be taking refuge in
the evening like the others.

You should run, too.
It seems it's going to fall
tomorrow morning.

I'm sorry.
Our rooms are filled.

Oh, Tortus, you're late...

Tomorrow is another early day, so
good night. I'll read you a story
tomorrow.

Oh, Tortus.
Did you finish helping father?

Then let mother read you a story.

Now, which story would you like
to hear?

I'll pass
Carnival of Time  (2 hours)
Four Giants (Til morning)

The Carnival of Time, is it?

The carnival is almost here, so it's
good for you to learn its meaning.
It's a little long, but I'll read it
with some enthusiasm. Ahem...
"The Carnival of Time."
Each year, the season of harmony
begins when the sun and moon
are in alignment.
Paying homage to the way that
both nature and time are
tirelessly in the process of 
progressing...
the Carnival of Time is when the
peoples of the four worlds
celebrate that harmony and
request fruitfulness for the year.

For ages, people have worn masks
resembling the giants who are the
gods of the four worlds.

Now, it has become a custom for
each person to bring a handmade
mask to the Carnival of Time.

It is said that if a couple united
on the day of the festival and
dedicated a mask as a sign of
their union, it would bring luck.
The centerpiece of the carnival is
the clock tower, and on the eve
of all the festivities, the doors to
its roof are opened...
From atop the clock tower roof, a
ceremony to call the gods is held
and an ancient song is sung.

All of these festivities for the
Carnival of Time are held so that
we may ask the gods for a rich
harvest in the year to come!

You did a good job!
That's all for Tortus!

Now, when does the clock tower
roof open?
On the eve of the festival
I dunno

Well in that case, you try again
with mother.

You did a good job remembering.
That's the boy I'm proud of.

I'll give you some candy as a
prize.

Oh, are you awake?

I guess that story was a little
boring for Tortus, wasn't it?

Don't give up. Try again sometime.

The Four Giants, is it?

This is quite long, but it is a good
story for you to hear, so I'll read
it with some extra gusto.
Ahem...
"The Four Giants."
This tale's from long ago when all
the people weren't separated into
four worlds like they are now.
In those times all the people lived
together, and the four giants lived
among them.

On the day of the festival that
celebrates the harvest, the giants
spoke to the people...

"We have chosen to guard the
people while we sleep..."

"100 steps north,
100 steps south,
100 steps east,
100 steps west."
"If you have need, call us in a
loud voice by declaring something
such as, 'The mountain blizzard
has trapped us.'"
"Or 'The ocean is about to
swallow us.' Your cries shall carry
to us..."

Now then...There was one who
was shocked and saddened by
all this.

A little imp.

The imp was a friend of the
giants since before they had
created the four worlds.

"Why must you leave?"
 
"Why do you not stay?"

The childhood friend felt
neglected, so he spread his anger
across the four worlds.
Repeatedly, he wronged all people.
Overwhelmed with misfortune, the
people sang the song of prayer to
the giants who lived in each of
the four compass directions.
The giants heard their cry and
responded with a roar.
"Oh, imp. Oh, imp. We are the
protectors of the people."
"You have caused the people pain.
Oh, imp, leave these four worlds!
Otherwise, we shall tear you
apart!"
The imp was frightened and
saddened.
 
He had lost his old friends.
The imp returned to the heavens,
and harmony was restored to the
four worlds.

And the people rejoiced and they
worshiped the giants of the four
worlds like gods. And they lived
happily...ever after...

Good job! Wasn't that fun,
Tortus?

What did the people do to call the
giants?
Sing a song
I dunno

Oh, really?
But you listened hard, so mother
is happy.

I'll give you some candy as your
prize.

That's right, but you couldn't just
sing that song anywhere.

100 steps north,
100 steps south,
100 steps east,
100 steps west.
The spot at which those giants
parted is right in the middle of
this very town.

Oh, are you awake?

I guess that story was a little
hard for Tortus.

But don't give up. Try again later.

Oh, Tortus, are you ready?

It's been a long time since we've
had a picnic at Romani Ranch,
hasn't it?

Isn't her bridal dress lovely?

We promised each other when we
were children that we'd marry on
the day of the Carnival of Time.

...But my promise...
I couldn't keep it.

I...I have met you before.

What a familiar scent. Long, long
ago...Yes. We were still young.
We made a promise...
Didn't we?
The masks of the sun and the
moon...

We were to exchange them on the
day of the Carnival of Time...

Anju...
I'm sorry I was late.

...Welcome home.

...Tee-hee! They're lovers, but they
look just like a mother and child.

Let us exchange the promised
masks.

We have exchanged our oaths and
have become a couple.

You are our witnesses.
Please accept this mask.

Please take refuge.
We are fine here.

We shall greet the morning...
together.

Hmmm...Ah, well, that won't work...
No...That's too basic... 

We have to be ready without any
rehearsal this time...Every time...

We need a new step...Maybe with
more jumping...

Marilla likes this choreography,
but she doesn't get into it at all...

Judo's very good at it...
Maybe we should add some
spins...

If we do a poor job of extending
it, the audience will get bored...

Maybe I'll blame it on the troupe
leader and go back to the village...
But Judo wouldn't like it.

We shouldn't change the song
now...Guru-Guru is scary when he
gets mad...

We're pretty prepared, but our
troupe leader seems to be acting
strange for some reason.
Well, we haven't even seen the
stage yet...It looks like we're going
straight to the big show without
any rehearsal.

Master!
Please come to our performance!

Don't bother us!!!

Thank you for teaching us those
steps.

You are our master!

Master! You're so cool!

Doo-doo-doooo...
Don't speak to her right now. 

She hasn't finished her new dance
for the town's carnival
Doo-da-daa...

Even though the song is finished.

Doot-doo-dooo...
No time is left.
The dance isn't finished yet.

The song is now done,
but the dance is not.

I wish someone would teach them
one...A fancy step for these girls.
...Do-dee-do...

La-la-la...
They said I was
much too loud
when I practiced in my room.
They got mad.
Sigh...Now I'm sad
I'll just stay here all night and
away from their pad.

La-la-la...
They said I was
much too loud
when I practiced in my room.
They got mad.
Sigh...Now I'm sad.
I'll just think about the past
to keep my mind off the bad.
Ah, yes, I'll do that...

Dear guest...Long ago, I was in an
animal troupe, with dogs and
donkeys and such.

Why could a...? Why could a...?
Why could a man join?!?
That's 'cause a man is an animal,
too, my boy!

They were all great. But there
was one thing I didn't like
about it...

Why was the...? Why was the...?
Why was the dog the leader?!?
Was it 'cause something was
wrong with me, sir???

Oh, that dog was an amazing
leader! He always had a
stellar troupe no matter what
animals he had to work with...

That's why I...That's why I...
That's why I stole it...
The dog's mask.
I stole it.

I wanted it because it was the
leader's mask...

But I no longer need it...
I give it to my guest.

The leader was a good instructor.
His members matured quickly and
they became adults in an instant.

My, my! Funny things are
happening in town, aren't they?
Funny. Funny.

You're telling me! Like the rumors
about the swamp to the south?
Did you hear about the
kidnapping?

Oh, my!
The kidnapping?

Yep!
But then the kid woke up.
Get it? Kid napping?
Hooo...I got a million of 'em!

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

We're the twin jugglers from the
Gorman Troupe! We're practicing
for the big carnival! It happens
once in a blue moon!

Or in this year's case, once in
a really, really scary, red-eyed
moon!

Ho! Ho! I hear it's gonna fall
harder than the way my clumsy
brother is always dropping our
juggling balls!

You see, we're entertainers. We
must keep people smiling. No
matter how grim things get,
we must always be optimistic!

Did you meet the Rosa sisters,
our fellow performers from the
troupe? They're twins, too!

They're twins just like us! Can
you believe it? I think they're
practicing somewhere in West
Clock Town right now.

There are two sets of twins
traveling in Gorman's troupe of
entertainers! I mean, what are the
chances?

I'd say the chances are about one
in a million! No, wait...
Make that four in a million!

Would you like to join our 
little card game?

You're joking, aren't you, brother?
He'll make our game too complex!

What ever do you mean?

It's easy playing against you!
You look just like me, so I already
know what you look like when
you're bluffing!

Pa-Pa-Pa-Paper, please!

N-Not that!

Yeah!

Ho!
You saved me...

This fell down here...
I'll give it to you.

La-la-la...They said I was too loud
when I practiced in my room.

They got mad.
Sigh...Now I'm sad.
I'll just stay here all night and
away from their pad.
And you are a child, so you must
go to bed.

La-la-la...They said I was too loud
when I practiced in my room.

They got mad.
'Til morn, I'll stay here.
'Til the pain is gone, I'll stay here.
Do-da-da, do-dee, do-dee...

Oh, what a cute guest.
Do you have a reservation?
Where's your mother?

I'm sorry.
We're totally booked with
reservations. Please tell that to
your mother.

I'm sorry.
We're totally booked with
reservations. Please tell that to
your mother.

Hello, Mr. Scrub.
How about this rain?

Do you scrubs feel sad on rainy
days, too?

....
But Deku Scrubs are supposed to
like rain. At least one of us has
reason to be happy...

I need to be happier, don't I?

Don't speak to me wearing such
an unpleasant mask!

Please take refuge.
We are fine here.

We shall greet the morning...
together.

You really don't have it-goro?

I really don't have it.

Really-goro?

I'm terribly sorry.

Umm, Anj..
We'll be leaving right away...
Mumble, mumble....

The wind has gotten damp-goro...
Tomorrow is rain-goro... 
Goro-goro...

Please tell me!

It's a secret.

I must know!

Doo-doo-doooo...
Don't talk to her right now.

Although the dance for the
carnival is ready, the troupe leader
won't come to view it.

Though the song is ready, the
troupe leader won't come to
hear it.

Doo-doo-doooo...
Though we're running out of time,
the troupe leader won't wake up.

In time's like this, it means the
leader has something he's hiding
from us.
Do-dee-da-da...
But the song is done...

We'll talk in the kitchen...

I have decided we will leave the
town tomorrow. We can't expect
anyone to attend our show.

Aren't you going to flee?

If you have nowhere else to go,
you should seek refuge at the
Gorman Track in the south. That
is my brothers' ranch.
My older brother...He's a nice guy.

.........

Green hat...
Green clothes...

Anju wrote about you in her
letter.

It seems you are looking for
Kafei.

...Can you keep a secret?
Yes
No

...Listen, when someone asks you
that, you say yes.

Anju trusted you.
I shall also trust you.

I am Kafei.

The Kafei we're looking for is an
adult. When I look at you, I just
see a child.

I was turned into this by a
strange imp wearing a mask...

But I'm not hiding because I look
this way.

When I was turned into this,
I went to see the Great Fairy in
the shrine near the North Gate...

But on the way, my precious mask
--a wedding ceremony mask--was
stolen from me by some prancing
man with a grinning face!

Well...You're just careless.
You're like my partner...

Before my wedding ceremony I was
quite happy. I was targeted
because of what I had been
turned into.

Oh my. I pity you.

I know Anju is worried...but I can't
go out yet.
I made a promise to her that I
would bring the wedding mask and
greet her.

This pendant...
Give it to Anju.

Keep what we just talked about a
secret from everyone.

Things that get stolen in this
town always make their way to
the Curiosity Shop.

I'm waiting for that to happen.

Stand on that crate and peek into
that hole.

From here, I check on the
Curiosity Shop's customers.

That guy will definitely appear.
I'll be waiting when it happens.

Come in.

T'night...
I got nuthin' to sell. I kid you not.
Can I buy somethin'?

I'll pay ya good for it!
Show it to me with (C).

Sorry, but I can't sell that here.

Can I buy somethin'?
Yes
No

Thanks.
Come in again.

You gotta look around.
I'm doin' a special sale.
Check it out.

Tonight's special bargain was just
stolen. It just came in seconds
ago. This is really hot!
I kid you not!
Actually, it's somethin' sold over
at the Bomb Shop, but a thief
sold it to me...

It's a Bomb Bag.
Check it out! Buy it!

Tonight's bargain is
the All-Night Mask for use at
bedtime.

I forgot when this was made, but
it sure is a freaky mask...See?

When you put it on, you can try 
and try to fall asleep, but you
won't be able to.
Pretty creepy, huh?

So...Can I buy somethin'?
Yes
No

Thanks.
Take care, buddy!

Huh?
You the green hat kid?

I got a message from Kafei.

Now Kafei...
I've known him since he was real
little...

But when he showed up looking all
young in that little brat body,
I didn't know what I was seeing! 
 
All it took was one glance at that
Keaton Mask he was carrying for
me to realize that I was looking
at my old friend.
I gave him that mask a long time
ago when he was just li'l Kafei.
Didn't know he kept it that well
for so long...

I'm not sure why, but...I want to
give this to you.

A customer came to my shop last
night...

Now Kafei sees him, and Kafei's
color just changes and he goes
runnin' after the guy.

The guy's a regular...
A greedy thief named Sakon.

I think he's from Ikana Village...

...100.

Don't be such a Rupee pincher,
you miser.
200!

Well, why don't I just offer you
even less? And y'know, this is the
Bomb Shop's! How 'bout if I tell
'em all about you?

All right. Fine. I'll take it, but
you're guilty, too!

Don't be a fool!
A seller of stolen goods is just a
middleman who's trying to provide
his customers with good product.
Look, I know nothing.
If it comes to me, I buy it!
I'm a charitable organization that
helps people in need!

I...I understand.
Then the total is...

It's 50 now.
So there ya go.

What?
You said 100...

Ohhhh...So you don't want me
to take it off your hands...

W-W-Wait! It's a deal! It's a deal!

For that, I'll give you

I'll take it

You don't have enough Rupees!

Now Kafei...
He says he wants you to take
this to his mother.

Nice Sword: 100 Rupees
Just got this sword in. It's a 
deal. I kid you not.

Nice Sword: 100 Rupees
 
I'll buy it
No thanks

Good Sword: 50 Rupees
You don't have a sword, buddy.
At this price, this one's a steal.
Heh-heh...

Good Sword: 50 Rupees
 
I'll buy it

I've got the goods tonight. They
came in through good channels.

This Curiosity Shop guy's takin'
advantage of me...I just want my
fair share...

Ouch! Watch out!

Stop! Thief!!! Give the old lady
her luggage back!!!

Oh my. And I thought we would
finally be able to stock Bomb Bags
in our store. What a shame...

Oh my. You think it'll never
happen to you. Well, now I've
learned my lesson.

And I thought we would finally be
able to stock Bomb Bags in our
shop. It's too bad...

Thank you. Since he didn't make
off with them, I can finally stock
Bomb Bags at our shop. Maybe I'll
put 'em out tomorrow.

Yes, I must thank you. It's a
dangerous mask, but maybe you
could use it to throw your own
festival fireworks show.

Well, thanks for helping me.
Take care...

Ah, well...
That's a small customer.

Be careful during the fireworks.
You can use bombs once you
become an adult.

Take care during the fireworks.
You can use bombs once you

I'm sorry.

I'm not doing anything suspicious...
Really.

Are the fins damp lately?

What? Mikau???
Am I wrong?

You look so much like him...
So sorry, so sorry.

Are you here buying fish? With
the ocean the way it is...

All we can do is put up with the
town's smelly fish, you know...

When you get back to Zora Hall,
give everyone my regards.
You sure do look like him,
though...

With the ocean the way it is, the
professor at the lab has started
raising fish.

See, we don't catch fish anymore.
We eat them after raising them...
It's like cultivating vegetables.

I'm thankful and all, but he feeds
fish to his "crops." Feeding fish to
fish...That's a scary thought.

That's the greeting used among us
Zoras.

Oh, forgive me. I am Toto,
manager of the band, The
Indigo-Go's.

I'm out of business cards, so a
Zora greeting will have to do.

The Indigo-Go's is the popular
group that we Zora are so proud
of. They've put out a lot of songs.

One of their hits is
"Ballad of the Wind Fish."
You know that song, don't you?

Huh? You don't?
Really?
Even one that famous?
Hmmm...
You'd be able to hear it if the
show wasn't canceled. It's such
a shame.

Canceling the show isn't
something I want to do at all.

It was the first performance at
the carnival for The Indigo-Go's in
a while, so I'm sorry for the fans.

But with the diva the way she is
right now, a show would be...

Urr...Lately, only bad things have
been happening at Zora Hall...

Oh my, you...

You're the one I asked to search
for Kafei. So did you find
anything?

...What? What's this?
You've got nothing?!?

Tsk. Tsk.
Oh, please keep trying!

Oh dear, are you on a field trip?
This is my office. The Mayor's
office is next door.

If you need to speak to me about
the carnival performances, make
an appointment, please.

Oh dear, are you on a field trip?
...Or are you the expert person-
finder I hired?

Yes, yes, yes. I say, you have the
face of a pro.
 

The characteristics of the person
I want you to find..
Yes, yes. I know them.

The person I want you to locate
is my son, Kafei. You know him,
don't you? 
...You don't? Really?
He disappeared about a month ago.
It's terrible! I'm so very worried...
I can't get food down my throat,
and I've lost five pounds.
You haven't anything, though?
Oh, dear...

Well? Could you look for him?
Yes
No

Oh, that won't do.
I cannot accept that.

Oh my, of course. You are an
expert. Well, I'm counting on you!

Bah! Bother! Bother! I'm busy!

I am of the Gorman Troupe. I have
an appointment to meet with
Madame today...

Oh, really?
Then that should be fine if you
just go in.

Madame Aroma, I am Gorman.
It has been some time...

Thank you for letting us perform
at this year's Carnival of Time.

Oh, dear me...
Gorman! There's a problem!

Meaning?

The opening performance I've
asked you to do...

Ah, yes...

They've canceled!
Just now!

W-Wha-What's this?!?

Allow me to explain.

Oh, excuse me...I am to
work at this year's show
...Or that was the plan.

I am Toto, manager of the Zora
band, The Indigo-Go's.

He arrived this morning.

Actually, there's been an
unusual accident in Great Bay...

And due to this unusual accident,
Lulu, the diva in The Indigo-Go's,
has lost her voice.

Why?

Why?

The details are quite long, so I'll
spare you. At any rate...

I must cancel our performance at
this year's Carnival of Time.

See!

Then this means...
the Gorman Troupe's...
jo-job is...

It's off...

Bu-but that's!

That's all, Gorman. There's always
next year. I'm busy with
other matters.

Bah! Bother! Bother!
I'm busy!

I'm angry now!
Don't speak to me.

...They must be joking. Now what
am I to do?!?

All must take refuge!!!

On with the carnival!!!

Most of the townsfolk already
have taken shelter without waiting
for the Mayor's orders.

The only ones left are public
servants and committee members...

Mr. Mayor and Carnival Committee
Members, please order those who
remain to evacuate!

Ahh...hmm...well...

You cowards! Do you actually
believe the moon will fall?

The confused townsfolk simply
caused a panic by believing this
ridiculous, groundless theory.

The soldiers couldn't prevent the
panic, but outside the town walls 
is where the danger is!

You want answers? The answer is
that the carnival should not be
canceled!

Isn't that right, Mr. Mayor?

Are you serious, Mutoh?!?

It seems that giant chunk of rock
above us hasn't caught your eye!

At this time every year, we are
overrun by tourists! So why is
the town empty?

Clearly, it's your job to ensure
the carnival's operation, but that's
if people are here for it!

Don't drag the merchants and
soldiers into this!

Mmm...Hmm...

If the soldiers wish to run, then
run, Viscen! We councilmen will
stick to tradition.

This carnival will be a success!
I've never heard of a defense unit
abandoning its town!

Madame Aroma would surely say
the same thing, wouldn't she,
Mayor Dotour?

...Let's not bring my wife into this.

You take refuge, too.

Ah!

Ah!

Ah!

The Couple's Mask. What a nice
reminder...So, a young couple has
been married.

I wonder...Did my wife flee?

What!?!
What did you just say?!?

Yes, yes, everyone. We are all
worried for our families. Why don't
we end this meeting?

But, Mr. Mayor!

This will do. Whether you're
stubborn and will stay and guard
your family, or if you'd prefer to
run far away and seek shelter...
That is for people to decide on
their own.

........!

Thank you for allowing me to put
an end to all that pointless
bickering.

Adults are all so stubborn...
It is shameful.

Here is a token of my gratitude.

Well, I may be an unreliable
Mayor, but at least my family can
depend on me. I want to protect
my wife.

...I tell you...It's hard to figure
which way things will go.

...I tell you...It's hard to figure
which way things will go.

See, because Mutoh said he would
call my wife...

The carnival is...on.

Captain Viscen!

...The Mayor's orders are absolute!

So the gate guards are still
standing by...

...Standing by!
Cripes!

Welcome
Do you have some
business?

The room on the left is
the Mayor's room...

It sounds like they're having some
kind of meeting, I think.

The room on your right is the
drawing room and it's also Madame
Aroma's office. 

...My directions...
Do you want to hear them again?

So...

The room on your left is the
Mayor's Office...

And the room on your right is the
drawing room and it's also Madame
Aroma's office.

The room on your left is
The Mayor's office...

It sounds like their...
whatchamacallit... meeting ended.
A lot of tough guys walked out.

The room on your right is
the drawing room and it's also
Madame Aroma's office.

Don't go in there without an
appointment. The lady will get mad
at you.

Are the fins damp lately?

Oh. That's the greeting used
among us Zora.

Where's your momma, sonny? Huh?
You came here by yourself? Well,
aren't you a big boy?

Once you get older, sonny, come
see The Indigo-Go's perform live at
Zora Hall.

Oh dear, are you a student of
Deku Elementary?
Where's your teacher?

You shouldn't be here. Field trips
go next door. Tell your teacher
that.

Did you find your teacher?
Your teacher's not here???
Well, then I don't know what to do
with you...

Just what should I,
I mean the Gorman Troupe, do?

Oh, Gorman, I wish it was only
your face that was annoying me
right now.

...So I may enter, miss?

Ahh...I think so.

....

That's that...

The bar opens at night, sir.

And it's members-only. We refuse
people who don't have proof of
membership.

Well, now I'm getting things ready,
so as long as you don't get in the
way of my cleaning, you can stay.

We're called a Milk Bar, and we
serve the milk of the night.

Our most popular, of course, is
Chateau Romani. It's a vintage
milk.

It comes from Romani Ranch, and
the current price is 200 Rupees!

...You're not surprised?

There is one more surprising thing
about this milk...

It depends on who you ask, but
there are those who consider this
milk as a source of Magic Power!
It takes just one gulp they say!
It's expensive, but thankfully, it's
the one we serve the most.

Last night, we got some fresh
milk in for the first time in quite
a while.

Finally, we can feel good about
our drinks' quality again.

But that moon...Our regular
customers have all fled. So there
really isn't any good news.

To make things worse, we're short
on stock.

There is a road to the south of
town called Milk Road.
This could be someone's prank...
You see, the road is blocked by a
huge boulder.
I can't get any milk in from the
ranch now, so I can't please my
customers. It's terrible!

...Are you looking for young Kafei,
too?

It seems Madame Aroma still
doesn't know where he is...
But he's not the type to just run
off!
He must have a reason for not
showing himself.

Just wait...When the time is right
and he's ready...he'll show himself.

The young one's mask, eh?
I think it's a waste to look for
him.

What are you staring at?!?

Sounds like your show has been
canceled. You don't really need to
be here anymore.

I came to drink!
I...I'm a customer!!!

Well then, customer, the bar
opens at 10 o'clock at night.
Please wait 'til then. And besides
that...

This bar is for members only.
Those without proof of membership
will be refused entry.

Well, then I don't need milk!
I just want to sit and think for a
while... 

Just give me a place to do that...

Fine. Be my... guest.

Ohhhh...What am I going to say to
the troupe members?

Sir...It's the rules. Please wear
your Romani's Mask inside the bar.

Welcome...
 
Speak to shopkeeper
Have a drink

What'll it be?

Regular Milk: 20 Rupees
Chateau: 200 Rupees
Nothing

You don't have enough Rupees, sir.

Give me a call when you make up
your mind.

Members of this club bring their
own glasses.

We ask that you have an empty
bottle to drink out of when you
order.

There is a road to the south of
town called Milk Road.

Someone must've pulled a prank
out there, because the road is
blocked by a huge boulder.

I can't get any milk in from the
ranch, so I'm not sure if I should
recommend the Chateau Romani
to you.

...As you can see, all of our
customers have taken refuge.

It may be my undoing, but I'm the
sort of fellow who'll stay at his
business through thick and thin.

And I continue standing here
at the counter hoping one of my
favorite customers will appear...

And I wasn't wrong.
See? You stopped in.

We've got some good milk in
tonight.

Would you like some Romani for
your final moon viewing?

I remember when I was back at
the ranch. My brothers...
I wonder how they are...

Hey ...You!

Milk...

It's miiiilk...

Can you get tipsy from something
like milk?!? Hic!

...What? Hic!

...Don't look at me! Hic!

Anyway, I'm just the despised
second son!

I can't handle horses like my older
brother!

I can't take care of horses like
my younger brother!

I left the ranch, came to know
the world of show business...
Traveled around...
But for what?

...For nothing!!!

Oh, I just had to enter the world
of entertainment, didn't I?
It's cold...Soooo cold...

Oh dear, are you all right with
not fleeing?

It looks like this is it for this
town, you know. You saw the
moon, didn't you? It's gotten so
huge.
All the townsfolk have fled. You
should flee, too. Far away...

Oh dear, you're the one searching
for Kafei.

How is it?
Have you found him?

...Oh dear, is that so?
You haven't found him...

Well, that's enough.
Good work...
Now you flee, too...

And what does that have to do
with anything?

Oh dear...Priority mail?

This!!!
It's from Kafei! Correct?
Correct?

Wonderful! You really are an
expert!

Yes, yes, I'm sorry.
My thanks.
Yes, yes, it is your job, after all.

I'm sorry.
At this point in time, I can give
you only something like this.

Actually I wanted to give this to
you sooner...
Really!

Hey, are you going to play for us
again?

I wanted you, too, to hear Lulu's
voice on this stage.

We were scheduled to do a show,
but it got canceled.

This place has a reputation for
being a great live venue, so it's
a shame.

I'd like to do a sound check,
though. I just want to see what it
would have been like...
Hey, you!

Could you help me with
a performance?
Yes
No

Oh, that's too bad.

OK! You play guitar, right?
Stand beneath the spotlight on
the right.

Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The guitar goes on the right,
the right!

OK!
Play your guitar like this...

OK! You play the pipes, right?
Go stand under the front-left
spotlight.

Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The pipes go under the front-left
spotlight!

OK!
Now, play your pipes like this...

OK! You play the ocarina, right?
Go stand under the center
spotlight.

Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The ocarina goes under the center
spotlight!

OK!
Play your ocarina like this...

OK! You play the drums, right?
Go stand under the rear-left
spotlight.

Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
The drums go under the rear-left
spotlight!

OK!
Play your drums like this...

OK!
That feels good!

What feels good?!?
That wretched, senseless racket?!

Bravo!!! That was the best!!!

Tha-That melody...

That melody...It brings back so
many memories!

It's their old standby...
"Ballad of the Wind Fish."

That's the song that members of
the previous generation of The
Indigo-Go's made famous!

I entered show business because I
heard this song at the Carnival of
Time long ago...

By doing performances, I thought
maybe I'd get to meet the singers
of that song...

The one you heard singing must
have been the original Lulu,
mother of the current lead singer
who's also named Lulu.

So her daughter is singing now...

Is that so?
I'd like to hear that...

I'm sorry I booed you...
Please, take my mask.

You've done good work...
Now you flee, too...

Ah, yes, you are a member...
I'm sorry, but the bar opens at
10 o'clock at night.

I'm getting things ready now.
If you just want to talk, I'll let
you stay...

I don't think I need to explain this
to a member, but...

Listen, buddy...
This is a place adults come to.
Come back once you're an adult.

Sorry, buddy.
I'd like to serve you milk, but
those are our rules...

Would you like the chance to buy
your dreams for 10 Rupees?

Too bad.

Moo!
Nice moooosic.
It reminds me of the pasture.

That song just makes me want to
let go and put out a lot of milk!

I'll give some to you.
Milk will make you very healthy.

Oooo my! Tooo bad.
If you had something tooo put it
in, I could have given you some...

Someone was up to some no-good
mischief and blocked the road to
Romani Ranch.

I'm sorry.
I'll remove it quickly.

Someone was up to some no-good
mischief and blocked the road to
Romani Ranch.

Sorry. Wait another day.

I opened the way.

.........
Hey, as long as it's open to
traffic, it's fine.

This is a little dangerous, so step
back...

This will take one more day.
It's dangerous, so step back...

Whooooa!
Isn't that too dangerous?

Whaaa?!!?
I thought I could break it!

...It's almost time.

It's almost time...
You take care of things outside,
Grasshopper!

If you have a map, watch your
map carefully!

OK? Whatever happens, do not let
them get into the barn!

They'll come from behind the barn, 
too, so watch out.

If you run out of arrows, we have
crates of them near the house,
so stock up when you need to.

Aaiieee-Aaaaaahhh!!!


........

We did it...We won.

Thank you! Thanks to you, the
cows are giving thanks, too!

Here's Romani's thanks. When you
drink it, put your hand on your
hip and take a big gulp like we do
here at the ranch!

It's almost time for my sister to
get up, so I have to get back to
bed...

See you later...Little hero.

Hey, who are you?

Ohh.
This is my first time meeting
a foreigner...

You're cute.

Hello, Mr. Foreigner.

Hey, who are you?

I'm Romani.
I was given the same name as the
ranch.

What's your name?
 
Link
I won't say my name

Link?
That's a nice name, but...

Hmm...
Well, all right then.

How about...
Grasshopper?
That's the name Romani gives you.

See, you're wearing green clothes,
and you patter about when you
walk, so Grasshopper it is!

Romani was practicing...
For tonight...Tonight...

They are coming...

They...
They come at night every year
when the carnival gets closer.

They come riding in a bright,
shining ball, and many of them
come down...to the barn...

My older sister won't believe me...

But Romani must protect the
cows!

Hey, Grasshopper, I'm recruiting
for an assistant right now!

You're a boy, won't you try?
Yes
No

Oh...I see...

My strategy begins tonight at
two. I'll be waiting by the barn...

I'll be waiting by the barn.

Great!
Now that's the spirit,
Grasshopper!

OK then, I'm going straight into
my strategy!

They'll appear all over the ranch...

They'll aim for that barn and
approach it slowly, so hit them
with arrows so they can't get in!

You got that? And you mustn't
leave the ranch!

Grasshopper!
Let's practice right away!

Will you help me, Grasshopper?
Yes
No

Want to practice again?
Yes
No

The operation begins tonight at
two. I'll be waiting in the barn.
Don't be late!

There are 10 ghost-shaped balloons
in the ranch, so hurry and burst
them all. If you take over
2 minutes, you're out.

The current record is
�.

Are you ready?

OK! Time's up!

When your arrow hits these, they
burst into nothing, but the real
ones will keep popping up!

If they get in the barn, we lose!

They run away at first light of
the sun, so we'll have to keep
fending them off until then!

Did you get that?
Yes
No

The operation starts tonight at
two. I'll be waiting in the barn.
Don't be late!

OK! You're done!

�?!?
Amazing! It's a new record!

�!
That's great.

You two work perfectly together!

I'll teach Romani's horse-calling
song to you, Grasshopper.

Now you two keep getting along,
and go practice some more!

Hey, aren't you a little rusty?

Want to practice?
Yes
No

Hmmm...Confident, aren't you?

Want to try again?
Yes
No

Keep at it!

.........

Huh? ...

You...

Practice?...You want to?
Yes
No

But...This...
What is this practice for?
...Romani...can't remember...

But this...
This practice you speak of...
What is it for?
...I just can't remember...

Who? Who are you, again?

�?!? That's probably...
a new record!

The record was �.
...I think.

Good evening, Mr. Foreigner!

Romani is looking after things.
My sister went to town.

...Ah!

My sister told me to never let
strangers know that!

I'm sorry!
Pretend you didn't hear that!
My sister will get mad at me.

Sorry!
Pretend you didn't hear that.
My sister will get mad at me.

Is that a carnival mask?

Oh, that's nice. Romani wishes she
could go to the Carnival of Time
just once! I've never been!

My sister always tells me that I'll
be an adult...someday!

That's fine for her! She gets to
go to town to make deliveries!

......

Romani knows...
My sister, Cremia, has someone in
town she likes...

But that person will get married
the day of the carnival. It's hard
for my sister...
Going into town...

......

Romani knows...
My sister, Cremia, has someone in
town she likes...

But that person is supposed to
get married the day of the
carnival. It's hard for my sister...
Going into town...

Thanks for helping last night.
The cows are doing well thanks
to you. And they're putting out a
lot of milk!

About last night...
It's a secret from my sister.
I don't want to worry her!

Listen, Grasshopper!
Romani is looking after things!

Now that we chased them away,
things are safe. My sister doesn't
need to know at all!

Hey, Grasshopper, can I ask you
to help next yea...

.....!
I know, Grasshopper!

Why don't you just live at the
ranch? I'll lend you Romani's bed.

My sister will be happy, too!
It's a great plan! So...It's decided!

You're our bodyguard, Grasshopper,
so you all you have to do is
practice hard!

Too bad.
Well, that's how it goes at first,
Grasshopper.

Confident, aren't you?

They...
They come at night...every year
when the carnival approaches...

They come riding in a bright,
shining ball. A whole lot of them
come down...

And then...
They come to the barn...

Oh my! Did you come from town?
Yes
No

Don't do that!
Lying to a lady...

You can get to this ranch only
from Clock Town...

Hmmm...
So you just didn't want me to
ask. Sorry for giving you such a
hard time.

...Then that means...

Milk Road is open to traffic!
Good! I can deliver milk to town
now!

Welcome to Romani Ranch,
Chateau Romani's Village.
Enjoy yourself.

These are Romani-bred.
My father left them for us.
An inheritance from the heavens...

The special Romani-bred cows
are the source of Chateau Romani,
the most desired of forbidden
milk!
It is a mystical milk that fills you
with Magic Power...

If you seek the dreamy milk of
Chateau Romani, please visit
Latte, near Clock Town's East
Gate.

.........

How was my sales pitch?
I wonder if I said it just like it's
written in the brochure.

Oh my? Did you come from town?
Yes
No

Don't do that!
Lying to a lady...

You can get to this ranch only
from Clock Town...

Hmmm...
So you just didn't want me to
ask. Sorry for being so hard on
you.

...Then that means...

Milk Road is open to traffic!
Good! I can deliver milk to town
now!

Welcome to Romani Ranch,
Chateau Romani's Village.

I am the ranch owner, Cremia.

She's my sister, Romani!

Pleased to meet you!
You're cute!

Hey now, Romani!
That's rude to our guest!

Yes, sister...

We put the cows to pasture when
morning comes. Do you know the
Romani breed?

The special Romani-bred cows are

most desired of forbidden milk!

.........

How was my sales pitch?
I wonder if I said it just like it's
written in the brochure.

That again, sister?
I'm sick of hearing it!

I'm supposed to!
It's work! Work!

Hey, come back when you grow up,
all right?

Oh...Sorry.
Now...I'm kind of...Thinking...
Last night...My sister...

The cows are all gone...
But please...Enjoy yourself...

Oh...Sorry.
Two days ago...My sister...
I'm sorry...

Our cows are all gone...
But please...Enjoy yourself...

Oh my...Hello.

Romani's going to take our milk to
Clock Town, too.

You're looking after the place!
The cows would be all alone
otherwise.

YES, sister...

I'm going by wagon into town.
Would you like a ride?

I'll be leaving about 6 o'clock this
evening, so you can join me if
you'd like.

I'm going by wagon into town.
Would you like a ride?

I'll be leaving about 6 o'clock this
evening, so you can join me if
you'd like.

Romani wants to go, too!!!

You can't!

Oh...I'm sorry.
Right now...I'm thinking...a little...
My little sister...
My sister, she...she...

What shall we do?
Our precious cows...

If I thought it would come to this,
then...What Romani said, I should
have...

...If I knew it would have come to
this, I would have never...

Oh...Good evening.

I'm going to town now to deliver
milk.

Oh...Well, I'll be leaving at 7:00
tonight, so come over if you
change your mind.

That's great. Tonight I'm kind of
lonely...
I welcome company.

Oh...Good evening.

I'm going into town now to deliver
milk.

I'm a little worried about my little
sister, but she should be fine...

What? The road...

Boy, get your bow ready...

First Milk Road is blocked by a
boulder and now...

We have to take this detour
through ugly country...

Are you ready, boy?
I'm going to try to get us through
here as fast as I can!

If any pursuers come from behind,
chase them off with your arrows.

They may be after my cargo of
milk bottles.

Do you understand?
 
No
Yes

Weren't you paying attention?
I'll tell you once more!

Thanks! I'm relying on you.
If we can get through here, I'll
have a big thanks for you!

My precious milk...
It's a mess...
I've failed as a ranch manager...

I'm sorry. I'm tired...
I need to get some rest.

Thanks for trying tonight...

Mr. Barten was happy to get his
first delivery in quite a while!

Thank you...
You were pretty cool...

This isn't very big, but accept my
thanks!

By doing one good deed, a child
becomes an adult.

That mask is only given to a
limited number of adult customers.
It's proof of membership.

I now acknowledge you as being
an adult!

I heard this from people who were
fleeing this way this morning...It's
terrible...

They said that huge moon is going
to crash down onto the town
sometime tonight. I wonder if we'll
be all right here...

Actually...
I know...
We're not safe here, either...

I'm no expert on these things,
but that's the feeling I get.
But...

That's how life goes, I guess.
There are some things in life that
you can't change no matter how
hard you try...

Oh...Good evening.

We're milking the cows tonight!
It's "Chateau Romani." It's the
first time I get to drink it!

Until now, my sister always said
"Wait until you're an adult."
But why now?

.........

You've become an adult now,
Romani...I see it in you.
I'm acknowledging it.

Then, does Romani get a mask,
too?

Well, yes, I'll make one for you...

Sleep with me in my bed tonight,
OK, Romani?

Yes, sister.

Good night...
See you...tomorrow...OK?

See you tomorrow!

Would you like a ride?
Yes
No

I'm sorry about giving you
only this. You have Romani's
Mask, don't you?

It's proof of Milk Bar membership.
Romani is a little expensive, but
please try it at the bar.

I guess it's been a while now
since our father died. I'm trying to
take care of the ranch, but things
have been getting unstable lately...e cows always seem bothered
and frazzled, and I'm finding
broken bottles everywhere...
Who's doing it, I don't know...

My sister Romani has been
worried, too. She's practicing using
a bow...She says it's to stop the
"ghosts."

Say, what are the townsfolk
saying about that moon?
It's bigger than before, isn't it?

In town...I have a friend.
Her name's Anju...
nju...
The day after tomorrow is her
wedding.

I wonder if it will fall...that thing?

You did it! You helped Cremia!

You feel all warm and fuzzy!
inside! Sigh...
You could get used to this!

Mr. Barten was happy to get his
first delivery in quite a while!

Thank you...
You were pretty cool...

This isn't very big, but accept my
thanks!

I'm sorry about giving you only
this. You already have Romani's
Mask, don't you?

It's proof of Milk Bar membership.
Chateau Romani is a little
expensive, but please try it at the
bar.

These guys are all roosters.
Heh, heh!

I heard it from my gramps.
Says the moon's gonna fall...

With somethin' that big, it's sure
to take this ranch down with it...
Hahhh...Oh, well.

My only regret is that I won't
get to see these guys in their
prime as roosters.

I don't really get it, but just
seein' these guys with a crest and
all...

I don't have regrets about
anythin' anymore. I'm perfectly
satisfied. Here...You can have this
from me...

Yeahhhh...These guys are all
roosters.
Heh, heh.

What do you want?

You know what this place is?
This is the Gorman Brothers' horse
training center!

You got no business here if you
got no horse.
Now beat it! Scram!

I told you this is a horse training
center! It means nuthin' if you
got no horse! Got it?

Hey, sir.
Heh, heh...What brings you here?

We're the Gorman Brothers and
this is our horse training center...
Without a horse...you...

Now, now...Don't get angry.
All right, if you don't have a
horse, go ahead and take a look
around.

This is just between you and me,
but if you need a horse, there are
a bunch next door at Romani
Ranch.
Some young girl's running it. I bet
she wouldn't notice if ya stole 
yourself one!

Hey, you!
What are you doin' in a place like
this?!?

We're the Gorman Bothers and
this our horse training center!

Don't come to a place like this
when you can't even ride a horse!

Won'tcha buy some fresh milk?

This is just between you and
me...

That milk they produce down
yonder at Romani Ranch is
watered down a bit. It's not worth
drinkin'.

We don't do that kinda thing here.
Ours is the real deal. It's always
fresh and full of vitamins.

It's true! I'll sell it cheap just for
you. How about it?

50 Rupees will do ya for one
drink!
I'll buy it
No thanks

Oh, really?
Milk this good'll cost you double in
town. This is true!

You don't have enough Rupees...

I'm only sellin' the milk! Where
d'ya expect me to put it? You
need an empty bottle if you want
some!

Much obliged.

Buyin' milk?

We're different from Romani
Ranch. Our milk is fresh and full
of vitamins. This is true!

Is that pathetic thing your horse?

I would've guessed that little thing
was a mule fer sure, ain't that
right, little brother?

Do ya think a horse that pathetic
would gallop if you pushed (+)
forward? Or would it run faster
if you pressed (A)?

This guy's funny!
Why don't you give us 10 Rupees
for the chance to race against
us?

If you win, we'll give you somethin'
nice, kid.

What'll you do?
 
Race
Don't race

Then don't come to a place like
this on your horse!

You gotta keep at least 10 Rupees
handy! Why would you carry
around a nice wallet like that
then?

It's a simple race. Just go once
around the track. If you can beat
us to the finish line, you win.

Hyuh, hyuh.
You ready?

Hyuh, hyuh!
We win!!!

If you like, we'll let you race us
again.

What'll you do?
 
Race
Don't race

This guy's no fun!
That's why you don't succeed!

I can't believe we lost!

Big bro, I wonder if we can give
that to this guy?

We gotta give him something. Well,
he's a kid, so what could he do
with it? It should be fine...

In exchange, you can't tell anyone
where you got this!

We gotta give ya something, 
so you got yourself some milk,
kid!

Urgh...I thought so...
No empty bottles!

Oh, that's really too bad. And I
was really gonna give it to you,
too. It's true!
...Too bad! Too bad!!

Easy there! Don't waste it!

Race against us for 10 Rupees?

If you win, we'll give you
somethin' nice kid.

Now that's not your horse, is it
now, sir?

Well, that thing's just a colt...

If you hang out 'round here, you'll
get eaten by that thar horse!

What?
Did you come runnin' here from
town?

Well it's been only that type of
folk coming 'round here lately.

Sorry, but this is no place for
you to take shelter.

You say the moon's gonna fall
soon? Ha! That's silly talk!

This is a horse training center!
It don't mean a thing if you don't
have a horse! Got it?

Ah, sir, do you have some
business at the Gorman Brothers'
Ranch on such a terrible day?

Hey you! What you doing in a
place like this on a day like
today?!?

We're the Gorman Brothers and
this is our horse training center.

If you don't hurry up and get
outta here, you'll get eaten by
that there moon!

Seems some monstrous Garos
appeared at Romani Ranch
yesterday.

And I heard the wagon carrying
their milk was attacked.

I tell you, that's a dangerous
place...

Seems like we're the only ones
who have any milk left.
Hyuh, hyuh.

If you like, I'll sell you some.

50 Rupees will do ya for one
drink!
I'll buy it
No thanks

Oh, really!
Milk this good'll cost you double in
town. This is true!

Heh, heh...Much obliged.

From here on out the milk
business will be ours!

We're the only place you'll be able
to get milk from!

Shall I sell you some?

Is that your horse?

I bet even that horse runs a little
if you press (+) forward. And it
probably runs faster if you press
(A) while riding it.

For 10 Rupees, you can have the
opportunity to race against us...

We're in a good mood today.
If you win, we'll give you
something good, kid.

Heh, heh...We win!!!
We're on fire!

If you want, we'll race you again...

What'll you do?
 
Race
Don't Race

Then we're busy. Now be off!

I can't believe we lost!

Big bro, I wonder if we can give
that to this guy?

We gotta give him something.
Besides, we don't need it anymore,
so what's the big deal?

In exchange, we don't want you
telling anyone where you got this
from!

We gotta give him something. And
that something is...milk!

Ugh...I thought so...You don't have
any empty bottles on you!

Oh, too bad. And I was really
gonna give you some milk if you
had an empty bottle to put it in...
It's true! Tooooo bad!

And they say the world is a hard
place. Look at you! I'd say you're
pretty lucky!

For 10 Rupees, you can race us.
How about it?

We're generous guys, so if you
win, we'll give you something really
good, kid. It's true!

Hey, sir, shouldn't you take refuge
somewhere?

I mean, there's that rumor and all.

If you hang around here, you'll get
eaten by a spooky Garo!

Ah, that mask...

That's our middle brother's
big bro!

So, he's gone into the world of
entertainment...

That younger brother of mine is
really struggling...

Compare what he does to what we
do...

No! No! Noooo!
And the things that we, the
Gorman Brothers, have done...

Grrrr...
We're the notorious Gorman
Brothers! We can't get all sappy
over stuff like this!

I'm sorry, but take that mask off.

I can't get anything done when
you gaze at me with that mask
on.

.........

Take that mask off.
I can't speak when you look at me
with that mask on your face.

.........

...It's no use.
When you look at me with that
thing on...I can't talk to you like
that...

I hear some ghosts or something
appeared at Romani Ranch
yesterday, and now all their cows
are gone.
That's one real dangerous ranch.

What do you want?

This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy
Racetrack, just like the sign says.

Do you want to try a dog race?
The minimum bet is 10 Rupees.

Will you still try?
Yes
No

Then first, go in and fetch the
doggy that you think will run the
fastest and bring it here!

Hurry up and bring me the doggy
that you think is fastest!

That's why I told you in the
first place! You can't play if you
can't pay the minimum bet of
10 Rupees!

Is that doggy fine?
Yes
No

Well, don't hesitate! Hurry up and
choose yourself a doggy!

If the dog you brought me takes
1st place, you get triple your bet.
2nd place gets double.

If the dog you've chosen places
3rd through 5th, you'll break even
and get back however much you
bet.
If your dog does any worse than
that, you'll lose whatever you bet.

How much will you bet?
�
Pick numbers with (+).
Press (A) to decide.

� then, right?
Yes
No

Well, take me for a walk and call
me Spot! You took 1st place.
1st place!!!

You win triple the amount of your
bet! That's �!

Sweet hounds of happiness!
You took 2nd! That's amazing!

You win double the amount of
your bet! �!

Oh, almost...
Well, I'll give you back the amount
you put down.

That was a bad choice!

If you don't know how your pup is
feeling, you won't be able to know
how it'll do in competition.
Get with it!

N-N-Nice going!
You've won over 150 Rupees, so I
have to give you a bonus prize,
too!

What? What do you want?

What do you want?
Coming here alone at night...

Did you read that sign?
This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy
Racetrack!

What do you want?
And in this weather?!?

This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy
Racetrack!

Other than enjoying the dog
races, there's nothing for you to
do here..

What do you want?
Coming here at night...

This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy
Racetrack! You got it?

What do you want on a day
like this?

This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy
Racetrack. Didn't you know that?

What do you want?
Are you going to be OK here?

This is Mamamu Yan's Doggy
Racetrack! You got that?

Oh, really?

I bet you don't have that many
Rupees. Come on, get real.

Well, you can't race then, can you? 
All right. All right. Calm down...

Ruff!
...Today, I should do pretty well.

Ruff!
My four paws feel lighter than
usual today!

Ruff!
Today, I feel like I can win...

Ruff!
...I'm here for my wife and child.
There's no way I'll lose!

Ruff!
Oh, yeah! I feel unstoppable.
I don't think I'll lose!

Ruff!
I wonder if my cute-faced owner
will let me quit practicing yet...

Rrr-Ruff!
I should do all right!

Rrr-Ruff!
I feel like I could win, but then I
feel like I could lose, too...

Rrr-Ruff!
I can't predict the future, so I
don't know how I'll do...

Rrr-Ruff!
I don't feel much different than
usual...

Hoo-whine.
Oh, my belly hurts! Ugh, I feel
terrible...

Hoo-whine.
I'm tired. I'm gonna take the day
off tomorrow. Can dogs do that?

Hoo-whine.
My head! I stayed up too late...
I shouldn't have been barking at
that moon all night...

Hoo-whine.
I'm too old for this. My right leg
hurts...The hind one...

Hoo-whine.
Did I lock the door to my
doghouse?

Oh, well, actually, I don't think
this is right for you...

If the doggies see a face like
yours, I think they'd all roll over
and play dead!

Oh...Actually I don't think I
can let you play...
If the doggies smell you, I don't
think I'd be able to pull them
away!

Oh, well, actually I don't
think this is a good idea...

I mean, look at you...
You know what doggies do to
trees, don't you?

Oh my, what are you doing to
my dogs? Put the dog down and
step away from the kennel!

You want to play again?
Yes
No
